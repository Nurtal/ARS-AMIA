22906139,Drug safety assessment in clinical trials: methodological challenges and opportunities.,"Randomized controlled trials are the principal means of establishing the efficacy of drugs. However pre-marketing trials are limited in size and duration and exclude high-risk populations. They have limited statistical power to detect rare but potentially serious adverse events in real-world patients. We summarize the principal methodological challenges in the reporting, analysis and interpretation of safety data in clinical trials using recent examples from systematic reviews. These challenges include the lack of an evidentiary gold standard, the limited statistical power of randomized controlled trials and resulting type 2 error, the lack of adequate ascertainment of adverse events and limited generalizability of trials that exclude high risk patients. We discuss potential solutions to these challenges. Evaluation of drug safety requires careful examination of data from heterogeneous sources. Meta-analyses of drug safety should include appropriate statistical methods and assess the optimal information size to avoid type 2 errors. They should evaluate outcome reporting biases and missing data to ensure reliable and accurate interpretation of findings. Regulatory and academic partnerships should be fostered to provide an independent and transparent evaluation of drug safety.",1,1,0,1,0
34954021,Improving the analysis of adverse event data in randomized controlled trials.,"Analyzing treatment harm is vital but problematic with the relatively small sample sizes afforded in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Good analysis practice for efficacy outcomes are well established but there has been minimal progress for the analysis of adverse events (AEs). In this commentary we examine four key issues for AE analysis. Namely, why harm data in RCTs is undervalued, why AE analysis is difficult, what aspects of current analysis practice are unsatisfactory, and the challenges for selection and interpretation of AEs results in publications. We discuss how the value of harm data from RCTs could be better realized by reframing the research question to one for detecting signals of adverse reactions. We align established good statistical practice to current unsatisfactory practice. We encourage use of Bayesian analyses to enable cumulative assessment of harm across trial research phases and discourage selecting AEs to report based on arbitrary rules. We propose comprehendible summaries to be based on core outcome sets, serious and pre-specified events, and events leading to discontinuation. Analysis of AEs in contemporary clinical trials needs attention to progress. In the following we have outlined immediate, mid and longer-term strategies for trialists to adopt to support a change in practice.",1,0,0,1,0
37580910,Identification of risk factors for adverse drug reactions in a pharmacovigilance database.,"In addition to identifying new safety signals, pharmacovigilance databases could be used to identify potential risk factors for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). To evaluate whether data mining in a pharmacovigilance database can be used to identify known and possible novel risk factors for ADRs, for use in pharmacovigilance practice. Exploratory data mining was performed within the Swedish national database of spontaneously reported ADRs. Bleeding associated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran-was used as a test model. We compared demographics, drug treatment, and clinical features between cases with bleeding (N = 965) and controls who had experienced other serious ADRs to DOACs (N = 511). Statistical analysis was performed by unadjusted and age adjusted logistic regression models, and the random forest based machine-learning method Boruta. In the logistic regression, 13 factors were significantly more common among cases of bleeding compared with controls. Eleven were labelled or previously proposed risk factors. Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation), hypertension, mental impairment disorders (e.g., dementia), renal and urinary tract procedures, gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation, and interacting drugs remained significant after adjustment for age. In the Boruta analysis, high age, arrhythmia, hypertension, cardiac failure, thromboembolism, and pharmacodynamically interacting drugs had a larger than random association with the outcome. High age, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, cardiac failure, and pharmacodynamically interacting drugs had odds ratios for bleeding above one, while thromboembolism had an odds ratio below one. We demonstrated that data mining within a pharmacovigilance database identifies known risk factors for DOAC bleeding, and potential risk factors such as dementia and atrial fibrillation. We propose that the method could be used in pharmacovigilance for identification of potential ADR risk factors that merit further evaluation.",1,0,1,0,0
30826796,Analysis and reporting of adverse events in randomised controlled trials: a review.,"To ascertain contemporary approaches to the collection, reporting and analysis of adverse events (AEs) in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a primary efficacy outcome. A review of clinical trials of drug interventions from four high impact medical journals. Electronic contents table of the <i>BMJ</i>, the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i>, the <i>Lancet</i> and the <i>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</i> were searched for reports of original RCTs published between September 2015 and September 2016. A prepiloted checklist was used and single data extraction was performed by three reviewers with independent check of a randomly sampled subset to verify quality. We extracted data on collection methods, assessment of severity and causality, reporting criteria, analysis methods and presentation of AE data. We identified 184 eligible reports (<i>BMJ</i> n=3; <i>JAMA</i> n=38, <i>Lancet</i> n=62 and <i>NEJM</i> n=81). Sixty-two per cent reported some form of spontaneous AE collection but only 29% included details of specific prompts used to ascertain AE data. Numbers that withdrew from the trial were well reported (80%), however only 35% of these reported whether withdrawals were due to AEs. Results presented and analysis performed was predominantly on 'patients with at least one event' with 84% of studies ignoring repeated events. Despite a lack of power to undertake formal hypothesis testing, 47% performed such tests for binary outcomes. This review highlighted that the collection, reporting and analysis of AE data in clinical trials is inconsistent and RCTs as a source of safety data are underused. Areas to improve include reducing information loss when analysing at patient level and inappropriate practice of underpowered multiple hypothesis testing. Implementation of standard reporting practices could enable a more accurate synthesis of safety data and development of guidance for statistical methodology to assess causality of AEs could facilitate better statistical practice.",1,0,0,0,0
24796347,Information on adverse events in randomised clinical trials assessing drug interventions published in four medical journals with high impact factors.,"The impact of the extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, which was published in 2004 and aimed to improve the quality of the safety information presented in clinical trials, remains uncertain. To assess the incorporation of the CONSORT statement extension's recommendations in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating drug therapies published in high-impact medical journals. Using Medline, 122 RCTs published in 2009 were selected from BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM. A structured form was used to identify the harms information reported in the RCTs, following the recommendations of the CONSORT statement extension. The most frequently met CONSORT recommendation was the mention of harms in the title or abstract of the paper (72.1% of the papers analysed); the least-met recommendation was the reporting of how the harms information was collected (10.7%). The studies that focused on harms presented better information on safety, but only 10.8% met all recommendations in the CONSORT statement. The adverse event information was insufficient for the RCTs published in four high-impact medical journals five years after the publication of the extension of the CONSORT statement.",1,0,0,0,0
19583556,Safety reporting in randomized clinical trials - a need for improvement.,"The reporting of adverse events (AEs) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is often lacking in the publication of trials. Part of the problem is the way safety data are reported in RCTs. Reporting of ""time to event,"" use of standardized incidence ratios for comparison to normal population or disease controls, use of ""patient years"" when reporting AE, and adequate sample size and power calculations are some of the problems that need to be addressed and improved in RCTs.",1,1,0,0,0
1941038,Pharmacoepidemiology in pre-approval clinical trial safety monitoring.,"Applications of pharmacoepidemiology to the pre-approval safety monitoring of investigational drugs are examined and compared with the post-approval applications. Pre-approval epidemiologic assessments of drug safety can complement clinical assessments of rare, serious adverse events occurring in open label uncontrolled clinical trials. Applications include retrospective identification of patient risk factors for adverse drug events and incidence comparisons based on historical controls. While similar in concept to applications of pharmacoepidemiology in the analyses of uncontrolled open label post-marketing surveillance studies, answers are often needed in days rather than weeks and the emphasis is on whether human studies can continue. Advance planning of historical data sources is essential as is an effective clinical trial data management system. Implications for methodologic research and for drug development are discussed.",1,1,1,0,0
23713541,The detection of adverse events in randomized clinical trials: can we really say new medicines are safe?,"While it is well known that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually designed with sufficient sample size and power to detect the efficacy but not safety of a medicine, the extent to which RCTs quantify safety has not been well ascertained. The aim of this study was to assess the safety data available for five commonly prescribed medicines at the time of marketing. Published RCTs for five medicines risperidone, sertraline, donepezil, strontium ranelate and tramadol extended release were identified. All adverse events (AEs) in the trials were independently extracted by two clinical researchers. Using the sample size in the trials, the power to detect the observed difference in AEs rates between the treatment and placebo groups was calculated. A power of 80% or more was deemed adequate to detect AEs; studies with power of < 80% were deemed insufficiently powered to detect AEs. 12 RCTs were identified. Six trials were insufficiently powered to detect any of the potential AEs reported. Of the 150 evaluated AEs, the trials were insufficiently powered to detect 81% (122/150) of the AEs reported. For the adverse events that were detected with adequate powered clinical trials, only 53% (10/19) of potentially very common AEs (≥10%) and 17% (18/106) of potentially common AEs (1%-<10%) were identified. Trials are insufficiently powered to detect the majority of adverse events that are reported in clinical trials, even for common adverse events. Observations other than primary efficacy endpoints such as AEs that are not prespecified with adequate power should be treated as hypothesis generating only and not justification of evidence. Claims of safety based on trial evidence not designed for the safety endpoint are often premature.",1,0,0,0,0
15154826,Clinical pharmacology: special safety considerations in drug development and pharmacovigilance.,"The dose of a drug is a major determinant of its safety, and establishing a safe dose of a novel drug is a prime objective during clinical development. The design of pre-marketing clinical trials precludes the representation of important subpopulations such as children, the elderly and people with co-morbidities. Therefore, postmarketing surveillance (PMS) activities are required to monitor the safety profile of drugs in real clinical practice. Furthermore, individual variations in pharmacogenetic profiles, the immune system, drug metabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are also important factors in the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. Thus, the safety of a drug is a major clinical consideration before and after it is marketed. A multidisciplinary approach is required to enhance the safety profile of drugs at all stages of development, including PMS activities. Clinical pharmacology encompasses a range of disciplines and forms the backbone of drug safety consideration during clinical drug development. In this review we give an overview of the clinical drug development process and consider its limitations. We present a discussion of several aspects of clinical pharmacology and their application to enhancing drug safety. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling provides a method of predicting a clinically safe dose; consideration of drug pharmacokinetics in special populations may enhance safe therapeutics in a wider spectrum of patients, while pharmacogenetics provides the possibility of genotype-specific therapeutics. Pharmacovigilance activities are also discussed. Given the complex nature and unpredictability of type B reactions, PMS activities are crucial in managing the risks drugs pose to the general population. The various aspects of clinical pharmacology discussed make a strong case for this field as the backbone of optimising and promoting safe development and use of drugs.",0,1,0,1,0
27301048,Under-reporting of harm in clinical trials.,"Appropriate safety evaluations of anticancer drugs are crucial to assess their benefit-risk ratio. Substantial evidence shows that clinicians under-report harm in clinical trials, and at least three factors contribute to this problem: assessment of harm by clinicians might not represent the experience of patients; harm might be detected within trials, but is not reported appropriately by investigators or reporting is influenced by sponsors; and short-term follow-up might not detect long-term and potentially serious toxicities. Additionally, because of the selection of patients with good functional status in clinical trials, study results might not apply to patients treated in everyday clinical practice. New approaches for the conduct, oversight, and reporting of clinical trials should include patient-reported assessment of side-effects. Effective pharmacovigilance programmes and large-scale observational studies are needed to improve understanding of the tolerability of anticancer drugs in a real world setting.",1,0,0,0,0
33258698,Meta-analysis of rare adverse events in randomized clinical trials: Bayesian and frequentist methods.,"Regulatory approval of a drug or device involves an assessment of not only the benefits but also the risks of adverse events associated with the therapeutic agent. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness, the number of treated patients in a single RCT may not be enough to detect a rare but serious side effect of the treatment. Meta-analysis plays an important role in the evaluation of the safety of medical products and has advantage over analyzing a single RCT when estimating the rate of adverse events. In this article, we compare 15 widely used meta-analysis models under both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks when outcomes are extremely infrequent or rare. We present extensive simulation study results and then apply these methods to a real meta-analysis that considers RCTs investigating the effect of rosiglitazone on the risks of myocardial infarction and of death from cardiovascular causes. Our simulation studies suggest that the beta hyperprior method modeling treatment group-specific parameters and accounting for heterogeneity performs the best. Most models ignoring between-study heterogeneity give poor coverage probability when such heterogeneity exists. In the data analysis, different methods provide a wide range of log odds ratio estimates between rosiglitazone and control treatments with a mixed conclusion on their statistical significance based on 95% confidence (or credible) intervals. In the rare event setting, treatment effect estimates obtained from traditional meta-analytic methods may be biased and provide poor coverage probability. This trend worsens when the data have large between-study heterogeneity. In general, we recommend methods that first estimate the summaries of treatment-specific risks across studies and then relative treatment effects based on the summaries when appropriate. Furthermore, we recommend fitting various methods, comparing the results and model performance, and investigating any significant discrepancies among them.",1,0,0,1,0
26679963,A Drug Safety Rating System Based on Postmarketing Costs Associated with Adverse Events and Patient Outcomes.,"Given the multiple limitations associated with relatively homogeneous preapproval clinical trials, inadequate data disclosures, slow reaction times from regulatory bodies, and deep-rooted bias against disclosing and publishing negative results, there is an acute need for the development of analytics that reflect drug safety in heterogeneous, real-world populations. To develop a drug safety statistic that estimates downstream medical costs associated with serious adverse events (AEs) and unfavorable patient outcomes associated with the use of 706 FDA-approved drugs. All primary suspect case reports for each drug were collected from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS) from 2010-2014. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was used to code serious AEs and outcomes, which were tallied for each case report. Medical costs associated with AEs and poor patient outcomes were derived from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) survey data, and their corresponding ICD-9-CM codes were mapped to MedDRA terms. Nonserious AEs and outcomes were not included. For each case report, either the highest AE cost or, if no eligible AE was listed, the highest outcome cost was used. All costed cases were aggregated for each drug and divided by the number of patients exposed to obtain a downstream estimated direct medical cost burden per exposure. Each drug was assigned a corresponding 1-100 point total. The 706 drugs showed an exponential distribution of downstream costs, and the data were transformed using the natural log to approximate a normal distribution. The minimum score was 8.29, and the maximum score was 99.25, with a mean of 44.32. Drugs with the highest individual scores tended to be kinase inhibitors, thalidomide analogs, and endothelin receptor antagonists. When scores were analyzed across Established Pharmacologic Class (EPC), the kinase inhibitor and endothelin receptor antagonist classes had the highest total. However, other EPCs with median scores of 75 and above included hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor, recombinant human interferon beta, vascular endothelial growth factor-directed antibody, and tumor necrosis factor blocker. When Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications were analyzed, antineoplastic drugs were outliers with approximately 80% of their individual scores 60 and above, while approximately 20%-30% of blood and anti-infective drugs had scores of 60 and above. Within-drug class results served to differentiate similar drugs. For example, 6 serotonin reuptake inhibitors had a score range of 35 to 53. This scoring system is based on estimated direct medical costs associated with postmarketing AEs and poor patient outcomes and thereby helps fill a large information gap regarding drug safety in real-world patient populations.",1,1,0,0,0
37855974,A Novel Method for Deriving Adverse Event Prevalence in Randomized Controlled Trials: Potential for Improved Understanding of Benefit-Risk Ratio and Application to Drug Labels.,"Adverse event (AE) data in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allow quantification of a drug's safety risk relative to placebo and comparison across medications. The standard US label for Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs typically lists AEs by MedDRA Preferred Term that occur at ≥ 2% in drug and with greater incidence than in placebo. We suggest that the drug label can be more informative for both patients and physicians if it includes, in addition to AE incidence (percent of subjects who reported the AE out of the total subjects in treatment), the absolute prevalence (percent of subject-days spent with an AE out of the total subject-days spent in treatment) and expected duration (days required for AE incidence to be reduced by half). We also propose a new method to analyze AEs in RCTs using drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence to improve safety signal detection. AE data from six RCTs in schizophrenia were analyzed (five RCTs of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor-based antipsychotic lurasidone and one RCT of the novel trace amine-associated receptor 1 [TAAR1] agonist ulotaront). We determined incidence, absolute prevalence, and expected duration of AEs for lurasidone and ulotaront vs respective placebo. We also calculated areas under the curve of drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence and mean percent contribution of each AE to this difference. A number of AEs with the same incidence had different absolute prevalence and expected duration. When accounting for these two parameters, AEs that did not appear in the 2% incidence tables of the drug label turned out to contribute substantially to drug tolerability. The percent contribution of a drug-related AE to the overall side effect burden increased the drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence, whereas the percent contribution of a placebo-related AE decreased such difference, revealing a continuum of risk between drug and placebo. AE prevalence curves for drug were generally greater than those for placebo. Ulotaront exhibited a small drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence curves due to a relatively low incidence and short duration of AEs in the ulotaront treatment arm as well as the emergence of disease-related AEs in the placebo arm. Reporting AE absolute prevalence and expected duration for each RCT and incorporating them in the drug label is possible, is clinically relevant, and allows standardized comparison of medications. Our new metric, the drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence, facilitates signal detection in RCTs. We piloted this metric in RCTs of several neuropsychiatric indications and drugs, offering a new way to compare AE burden and tolerability among treatments using existing clinical trial information.",1,0,0,1,0
34611721,Medication-related adverse events in health care-what have we learned? A narrative overview of the current knowledge.,"Although medication-related adverse events (MRAEs) in health care are vastly studied, high heterogeneity in study results complicates the interpretations of the current situation. The main objective of this study was to form an up-to-date overview of the current knowledge of the prevalence, risk factors, and surveillance of MRAEs in health care. Electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched with applicable search terms to collect information on medication-related adverse events. In order to obtain an up-to-date view of MRAEs, only studies published after 2000 were accepted. The prevalence rates of different MRAEs vary greatly between individual studies and meta-analyses. Study setting, patient population, and detection methods play an important role in determining detection rates, which should be regarded while interpreting the results. Medication-related adverse events are more common in elderly patients and patients with lowered liver or kidney function, polypharmacy, and a large number of additional comorbidities. However, the risk of MRAEs is also significantly increased by the use of high-risk medicines but also in certain care situations. Preventing MRAEs is important as it will decrease patient mortality and morbidity but also reduce costs and functional challenges related to them. Medication-related adverse events are highly common and have both immediate and long-term effects to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Conclusive solutions for prevention of all medication-related harm are impossible to create. In the future, however, the development of efficient real-time detection methods can provide significant improvements for event prevention and forecasting.",1,0,0,0,0
35214773,Adverse Events Reporting Quality of Randomized Controlled Trials of COVID-19 Vaccine Using the CONSORT Criteria for Reporting Harms: A Systematic Review.,"Assessing the quality of evidence from vaccine clinical trials is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and further enhance public acceptance. This study aims to summarize and critically evaluate the quality of harm reporting on randomized controlled trials for the COVID-19 vaccine and determine the factors associated with reporting quality. We systematically searched the literature using PRISMA guidelines for randomized controlled trials (RCT) on COVID-19 Vaccine until 30 December 2021. Published articles were searched from electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Bibliovid. Bias analysis was performed using RoB-2 tools. The quality of reporting was assessed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harm extension modified into 21 items. A total of 61 RCT studies (402,014 patients) were analyzed. Over half the studies demonstrated adequate reporting (59.02%), and 21 studies (34.4%) reported a low risk of bias. All studies reported death and serious adverse events (AEs), but only six studies mentioned how to handle the recurrent AEs. Reporting of AEs in subgroup analysis was also poor (25%). The RCTs on the COVID-19 vaccine were less biased with good quality on reporting harm based on the modified CONSORT harm extension. However, study quality must be considered, especially for a balance of information between effectivity and safety.",1,0,0,0,0
29785683,Targeted therapies and adverse drug reactions in oncology: the role of clinical pharmacist in pharmacovigilance.,"Background The majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) are based on pivotal clinical trials, performed under controlled conditions and with selected patients. Objectives (1) to observe ADRs in the real-world setting and to evaluate if the supervision of the pharmacist impacts on the management of ADRs and on the satisfaction of patients; (2) to sensitise health professionals and patients on the need to increase the reporting of ADRs, in compliance with Pharmacovigilance. Setting CRO Aviano, Italian National Cancer Institute. Method From February 2013 to April 2015, we conducted an observational study enrolling 154 patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing treatment with at least one of ten targeted-therapies included in the study. Main outcome ADR reporting in the real-world setting. Patient satisfaction with clinical pharmacist support. Results Reported ADRs in the real setting do not always correspond with data described in the respective SPCs. Unknown ADRs were also identified such as hyperglycaemia with lenalidomide and sorafenib; and hypomagnesaemia with bevacizumab. We also observed a 124.3% increase in spontaneous reports. Conclusion This study shows the high value of active pharmacovigilance programs, and our results might be a starting point for developing a randomised trial which should aim to demonstrate the impact of the pharmacist on improving patient's adherence and in measuring the difference in ADRs reports in the different arms followed or not by the pharmacist.",1,0,0,1,0
20183450,Statistical methods to analyze adverse events data of randomized clinical trials.,"The adverse events data of randomized clinical trials are often analyzed based on either crude incidence rates or exposure-adjusted incidence rates. These rates do not adequately account for an individual patient's profile of adverse events over the study period when an individual may remain in the trial after experiencing one or more events (i.e., occurrence of multiple events of the same kind or different kinds). Moreover, the required statistical assumptions (e.g., constant hazard rate over time) for valid estimates of incidence rates are not likely to be met in practice by adverse events data of clinical trials. A nonparametric approach called the mean cumulative function (MCF) provides a valid statistical inference on recurrent adverse event profiles of drugs in randomized clinical trials. The estimate involves no assumptions about the form of MCF. To demonstrate the applicability and utility of the MCF approach in clinical trial datasets, an adverse event dataset obtained from a clinical trial is analyzed in this article. As compared to the crude or exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events, the MCF estimates facilitate more understanding of safety profiles of a drug in a randomized clinical trial.",1,0,0,1,0
25083202,Comprehensive evaluations of the adverse effects of drugs: importance of appropriate study selection and data sources.,"While systematic reviews and meta-analyses are at the top of the evidence hierarchy, most of the methodology has focused on assessing treatment benefit. Hence, we propose a structured framework for the initial steps of searching and identifying relevant data sources so that adverse effects can be evaluated in a comprehensive, unbiased manner. The unique methodological challenges stem from the difficulties of addressing diverse outcomes encompassing common, mild symptoms to rare, fatal events. Retrieval of the most appropriate studies should be specifically tailored to fit the nature of the adverse effects, according to the primary objective and study question. In our framework, the structure of the review takes different forms depending on whether the main aim is on scoping/hypothesis generation, or evaluating statistically the magnitude of risk (hypothesis testing), or clarifying characteristics and risk factors of the adverse effect. The wide range of data sources covering adverse effects all have distinct strengths and limitations, and selection of appropriate sources depends on characteristics of the adverse effect (e.g. background incidence and effect size of the drug, clinical presentation, time of onset after drug exposure). Reviewers need to retrieve particular study designs that are most likely to yield robust data on the adverse effects of interest, rather than rely on studies that cannot reliably detect adverse effects, and may yield 'false negatives'. Type II errors (a particular problem when evaluating rare adverse effects) can lull us into a false sense of security (e.g. wrongly concluding that there was no significant difference in harm between drug and control, with the drug erroneously judged as safe). Given the rapid rate at which methodological improvements occur, this proposed framework is by no means definitive, but aims to stimulate further debate and discussion amongst the pharmacoepidemiological and systematic review communities to reach a common consensus on the best methods.",1,0,0,1,0
40433303,Patients prefer easy adverse event reporting: Observational study within clinical trial.,"Digital intervention safety is crucial for regulatory approval and clinical adoption. However, the evaluation and reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials are often insufficient. Digital qualitative self-reporting could enhance the detection of AEs, but patient preferences for using such channels remain understudied. This observational study was conducted in Finland between 2022 and 2024 within a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of <i>Meliora</i>, a game-based digital intervention for patients living with major depressive disorder. We assessed the preferences of 1001 patients for self-reporting AEs across four channels: a prompted, within-intervention questionnaire (CORTO: Contextual, One-item, Repeated, Timely, Open-ended), a Jira questionnaire, email, and phone. 148 (14.8%) patients reported AEs during the study. We found a significant imbalance between the channels: 11.3% (<i>n</i> = 113) of patients reported AEs using CORTO, 4.1% (<i>n</i> = 41) using email, 1.1% (<i>n</i> = 11) using Jira, and 0.4% (<i>n</i> = 4) using phone. These findings reveal that patients prefer low-effort methods for reporting AEs and are more likely to report AEs via a prompted, within-intervention questionnaire (CORTO) than through other methods. Integrating qualitative self-report channels into digital interventions may enhance AE detection rates, improve clinical trial safety monitoring, and support post-market surveillance.",1,0,0,0,0
37779893,Quality of reporting of adverse events in clinical trials of covid-19 drugs: systematic review.,"To assess the quality of reporting of adverse events in clinical trials of covid-19 drugs based on the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) harms extension and according to clinical trial design, and to examine reporting of serious adverse events in drug trials published on PubMed versus clinical trial summaries on ClinicalTrials.gov. Systematic review. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov registries were searched from 1 December 2019 to 17 February 2022. Randomised clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs used to treat covid-19 disease in participants of all ages with suspected, probable, or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Clinical trials were screened on title, abstract, and text by two authors independently. Only articles published in French and English were selected. The Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) was used to assess risk of bias. The search strategy identified 1962 randomised clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of drugs used to treat covid-19, published in the PubMed database; 1906 articles were excluded after screening and 56 clinical trials were included in the review. Among the 56 clinical trials, no study had a high score for quality of reporting of adverse events, 60.7% had a moderate score, 33.9% had a low score, and 5.4% had a very low score. All clinical trials with a very low score for quality of reporting of adverse events were randomised open label trials. For reporting of serious adverse events, journal articles published on PubMed under-reported 51% of serious adverse events compared with clinical trial summaries published on ClinicalTrials.gov. In one in three published clinical trials on covid-19 drugs, the quality of reporting of adverse events was low or very low. Differences were found in the number of serious adverse events reported in journal articles versus clinical trial summaries. During the covid-19 pandemic, risk assessment of drugs in clinical trials of covid-19 drugs did not comply with good practice recommendations for publication of results.

24228998,"Incidence, characteristics and risk factors of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized children - a prospective observational cohort study of 6,601 admissions.","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important cause of harm in children. Current data are incomplete due to methodological differences between studies: only half of all studies provide drug data, incidence rates vary (0.6% to 16.8%) and very few studies provide data on causality, severity and risk factors of pediatric ADRs. We aimed to determine the incidence of ADRs in hospitalized children, to characterize these ADRs in terms of type, drug etiology, causality and severity and to identify risk factors. We undertook a year-long, prospective observational cohort study of admissions to a single UK pediatric medical and surgical secondary and tertiary referral center (Alder Hey, Liverpool, UK). Children between 0 and 16 years 11 months old and admitted for more than 48 hours were included. Observed outcomes were occurrence of ADR and time to first ADR for the risk factor analysis. A total of 5,118 children (6,601 admissions) were included, 17.7% of whom experienced at least one ADR. Opiate analgesics and drugs used in general anesthesia (GA) accounted for more than 50% of all drugs implicated in ADRs. Of these ADRs, 0.9% caused permanent harm or required admission to a higher level of care. Children who underwent GA were at more than six times the risk of developing an ADR than children without a GA (hazard ratio (HR) 6.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.30 to 7.70). Other factors increasing the risk of an ADR were increasing age (HR 1.06 for each year; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.07), increasing number of drugs (HR 1.25 for each additional drug; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.28) and oncological treatment (HR 1.90; 95% CI 1.40 to 2.60). ADRs are common in hospitalized children and children who had undergone a GA had more than six times the risk of developing an ADR. GA agents and opiate analgesics are a significant cause of ADRs and have been underrepresented in previous studies. This is a concern in view of the increasing number of pediatric short-stay surgeries.",1,0,1,0,0
29685700,Randomized clinical trials and observational studies in the assessment of drug safety.,"Randomized clinical trials are considered as the preferred design to assess the potential causal relationships between drugs or other medical interventions and intended effects. For this reason, randomized clinical trials are generally the basis of development programs in the life cycle of drugs and the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. Instead, randomized clinical trials are not the design of choice for the detection and assessment of rare, delayed and/or unexpected effects related to drug safety. Moreover, the highly homogeneous populations resulting from restrictive eligibility criteria make randomized clinical trials inappropriate to describe comprehensively the safety profile of drugs. In that context, observational studies have a key added value when evaluating the benefit-risk balance of the drugs. However, observational studies are more prone to bias than randomized clinical trials and they have to be designed, conducted and reported judiciously. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of randomized clinical trials and of observational studies, more particularly regarding their contribution to the knowledge of medicines' safety profile. In addition, we present general recommendations for the sensible use of observational data.",1,0,0,0,0
27112273,Individualized versus standardized risk assessment in patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions (IDrug) - study protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to adverse drug reactions, especially if they are affected by additional risk factors such as multimorbidity, polypharmacy, impaired renal function and intake of drugs with high risk potential. Apart from these clinical parameters, drug safety and efficacy can be influenced by pharmacogenetic factors. Evidence-based recommendations concerning drug-gene-combinations have been issued by international consortia and in drug labels. However, clinical benefit of providing information on individual patient factors in a comprehensive risk assessment aiming to reduce the occurrence and severity of adverse drug reactions is not evident. Purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of a concise individual risk information leaflet with standard information on risk factors for side effects. The trial was designed as a prospective, two-arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter, pragmatic study. 960 elderly, multimorbid outpatients in general medicine are included if they take at least one high risk and one other long-term drug (polymedication). As high risk ""index drugs"" oral anticoagulants and antiplatelets were chosen because of their specific, objectively assessable side effects. Following randomization, test group patients receive an individualized risk assessment leaflet evaluating their personal data concerning bleeding- and thromboembolic-risk-scores, potential drug-drug-interactions, age, renal function and pharmacogenetic factors. Control group patients obtain a standardized leaflet only containing general information on these criteria. Follow-up period is 9 months for each patient. Primary endpoint is the occurrence of a thromboembolic/bleeding event or death. Secondary endpoints are other adverse drug reactions, hospital admissions, specialist referrals and medication changes due to adverse drug reactions, the patients' adherence to medication regimen as well as health related quality of life, mortality and resulting costs. Despite extensive evidence of risk factors for adverse drug reactions, there are few prospective trial data about an individualized risk assessment including pharmacogenetic information to increase patient safety. By conducting a health economic analysis, we will evaluate if the application of an individualized drug therapy in daily routine is cost-effective.

35125905,Incidence and risk factors of adverse drug reactions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A pharmacovigilance experience utilizing an ADR trigger tool.,"Since the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic, most countries started treating their patients with various therapies. However, the data regarding their safety and effectiveness is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) incidence and their predisposing factors among COVID-19 patients. A retrospective observational study that was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital from March - June 2020. Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years old, inpatient, had a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for COVID-19, and were treated with; (lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, ribavirin, or interferon-ß) either as monotherapy or combination therapy for three days or longer. The data of eligible patients were retrieved from the electronic medical records. A standardized data collection form was designed to collect patient demographics, COVID-19 severity based on the Saudi Ministry of Health management protocols, antiviral therapies, duration of therapy, and length of stay (LOS). The ADRs were identified via conducting a comprehensive review using predefined triggers and were evaluated using Naranjo Score. A total of 155 patients were included of which 123 (79.4%) were males. In our sample, the incidence proportion of ADRs per patient was 72.3%. A total of 287 ADRs were identified most of them were hepatic (n = <b>101</b>, 35.2%), gastrointestinal (n = <b>59</b>, 20.6%), hematological (n = <b>47</b>, 16%), and endocrine (n = <b>45</b>, 15%). Hydroxychloroquine was the most common drug associated with ADRs (n = <b>155</b>). The length of stay (10 - 20 days) was the only statistically significant with the ADR incidence (p-value = 0.008; 95 %CI 1.216:3.568). The ADRs are prevalent among COVID-19 patients, which assure the importance of implementing active hospital-based pharmacovigilance systems.",1,0,1,0,0
39470185,Improving adverse drug event reporting by healthcare professionals.,"Adverse drug events, encompassing both adverse drug reactions and medication errors, pose a significant threat to health, leading to illness and, in severe cases, death. Timely and voluntary reporting of adverse drug events by healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in mitigating the morbidity and mortality linked to unexpected reactions and improper medication usage. To assess the effectiveness of different interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to improve the reporting of adverse drug events. We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE and several other electronic databases and trials registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, from inception until 14 October 2022. We also screened reference lists in the included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised trials, non-randomised controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (ITS) and repeated measures studies, assessing the effect of any intervention aimed at healthcare professionals and designed to increase adverse drug event reporting. Eligible comparators were healthcare professionals' usual reporting practice or a different intervention or interventions designed to improve adverse drug event reporting rate. We excluded studies of interventions targeted at adverse event reporting following immunisation. Our primary outcome measures were the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) and the number of false adverse drug event reports (encompassing both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) submitted by healthcare professionals. Secondary outcomes were the number of serious, high-causality, unexpected or previously unknown, and new drug-related adverse drug event reports submitted by healthcare professionals. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We extracted and reanalysed ITS study data and imputed treatment effect estimates (including standard errors or confidence intervals) for the randomised studies. We included 15 studies (eight RCTs, six ITS, and one non-randomised cross-over study) with approximately 62,389 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries in large tertiary care hospitals. There was a high risk of performance bias in the controlled studies due to the nature of the interventions. None of the ITS studies had a control arm, so we could not be sure of the detected effects being independent of other changes. None of the studies reported on the number of false adverse drug event reports submitted. There is low-certainty evidence suggesting that an education session, together with reminder card and adverse drug reaction (ADR) report form, may substantially improve the rate of ADR reporting by healthcare professionals when compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting with or without some training provided by regional pharmacosurveillance units). These educational interventions increased the number of ADR reports in total (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.90; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), serious ADR reports (RR 3.30, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.21; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), high-causality ADR reports (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.57; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), unexpected ADR reports (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.75 to 12.76; 4 studies, 15,085 participants) and new drug-related ADR reports (RR 8.68, 95% CI 3.40 to 22.13; 2 studies, 7884 participants). Additionally, low-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting), making it easier to report ADRs by using a standardised discharge form with added ADR items may slightly improve the total number of ADR reports submitted (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.83; 1 study, 5967 participants). The discharge form tested was based on the 'Diagnosis Related Groups' (DRG) system for recording patient diagnoses, and the medical and surgical procedures received during their hospital stay. Due to very low-certainty evidence, we do not know if the following interventions have any effect on the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both ADR and ME reports) submitted by healthcare professionals: - sending informational letters or emails to GPs and nurses; - multifaceted interventions, including financial and non-financial incentives, fines, education and reminder cards; - implementing government regulations together with financial incentives; - including ADR report forms in quarterly bulletins and prescription pads; - providing a hyperlink to the reporting form in hospitals' electronic patient records; - improving the reporting method by re-engineering a web-based electronic error reporting system; - the presence of a clinical pharmacist in a hospital setting actively identifying adverse drug events and advocating for the identification and reporting of adverse drug events. Compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting with or without some training from regional pharmacosurveillance units), low-certainty evidence suggests that the number of ADR reports submitted may substantially increase following an education session, paired with reminder card and ADR report form, and may slightly increase with the use of a standardised discharge form method that makes it easier for healthcare professionals to report ADRs. The evidence for other interventions identified in this review, such as informational letters or emails and financial incentives, is uncertain. Future studies need to assess the benefits (increase in the number of adverse drug event reports) and harms (increase in the number of false adverse drug event reports) of any intervention designed to improve healthcare professionals' reporting of adverse drug events. Interventions to increase the number of submitted adverse drug event reports that are suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries should be developed and rigorously evaluated.",1,0,0,0,0
10849925,Risk factors for the development of adverse drug events in hospitalized patients.,"Adverse drug events in hospitalized patients lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Early detection of adverse drug events could aid in the prevention of these adverse outcomes. A cost-effective system for the early detection of adverse drug events should focus on high risk patients. A study was set up with the primary aim to identify characteristics that are associated with the development of adverse drug events (ADEs) in hospitalized patients. ADE reports were gathered from physicians and nurses (spontaneous reports) and from patients after intensive ward interviews by hospital pharmacists. All patients admitted to the internal medicine wards of two Dutch hospitals, during a two month period, were included. The following characteristics were analyzed for their potential relationship to the occurrence of ADEs: age (categorized), gender, number of drugs prescribed during hospital stay, types of drugs used and changes in drug use on admission. Age was found to be inversely associated with the development of ADEs (OR 0.36, CI 0.21-0.61 for age category > 80 years; OR 0.56; CI 0.31-1.02 for age category 75-80 years and OR 0.69; CI 0.42-1.11 for age category 60-74 years). Furthermore, statistically significant associations were found for the number of drugs prescribed per hospitalized patient (for the class of 4-6 drugs per patient OR 2.61, CI 1.32-5.18), for newly prescribed drugs (OR 6.65, CI 2.63-16.81) and for the cessation of drugs on hospital admission (OR 1.50, CI 1.02-2.20). The use of gastrointestinal drugs (OR 2.13, CI 1.32-3.45), central nervous system drugs (OR 1.66, CI 1.07-2.57) and antibiotics (OR 2.44, CI 1.65-3.60) were associated with the development of ADEs, when compared to all other drugs taken by the patients. In this study, the most important risk factors are the number of drugs used per patient and the starting of a new drug during hospitalization. As most hospitalized patients start new drug therapies while in hospital, this seems an inappropriate focus. However, careful monitoring of patients using more than 7 drugs at a time may be possible in a cost-effective system for the early detection of ADEs.",1,0,1,0,0
26350571,Risks of phase I research with healthy participants: A systematic review.,"Tragedies suggest that phase I trials in healthy participants may be highly risky. This possibility raises concern that phase I trials may exploit healthy participants to develop new therapies, making the translation of scientific discoveries ethically worrisome. Yet, few systematic data evaluate this concern. This article systematically reviews the risks of published phase I trials in healthy participants and evaluates trial features associated with increased risks. Data on adverse events and trial characteristics were extracted from all phase I trials published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and PsycINFO (1 January 2008-1 October 2012). Inclusion criteria were phase I studies that enrolled healthy participants of any age, provided quantitative adverse event data, and documented the number of participants enrolled. Exclusion criteria included (1) adverse event data not in English, (2) a ""challenge"" study in which participants were administered a pathogen, and (3) no quantitative information about serious adverse events. Data on the incidence of adverse events, duration of adverse event monitoring, trial agent tested, participant demographics, and trial location were extracted. In 475 trials enrolling 27,185 participants, there was a median of zero serious adverse events (interquartile range = 0-0) and a median of zero severe adverse events (interquartile range = 0-0) per 1000 treatment group participants/day of monitoring. The rate of mild and moderate adverse events was a median of 1147.19 per 1000 participants (interquartile range = 651.52-1730.9) and 46.07 per 1000 participants/adverse event monitoring day (interquartile range = 17.80-77.19). We conclude that phase I trials do cause mild and moderate harms but pose low risks of severe harm. To ensure that this conclusion also applies to unpublished trials, it is important to increase trial transparency.",1,1,0,0,0
37020083,Safety Surveillance During Drug Development: Comparative Evaluation of Existing Regulations.,"Drug safety monitoring is essential for developing efficient and safe treatments. It starts with preclinical toxicology studies and continues with the observation and analysis of potentially harmful effects in humans throughout the whole drug life cycle. Safety surveillance during the clinical phase is of paramount importance for protecting the health of clinical trial (CT) participants at a period when relatively little is known about the drug safety profile, and for reassuring that detected risks are minimized when the product obtains marketing approval. This review aimed to investigate current safety surveillance methods during drug development worldwide, in order to identify potential gaps and opportunities for amelioration. To this end, international guidelines, standards, and local legislations about CTs were reviewed and compared. Our review revealed common strategies, mainly in alignment with international guidelines, especially concerning the systematic collection, assessment, and expedition of adverse events by investigators and sponsors and the preparation of periodic aggregate safety reports by sponsors, as a means to inform health authorities (HAs) about the evolving benefit-risk balance of the investigational product. Inconsistencies in safety surveillance mainly concerned local expedited reporting requirements. Significant gaps were identified in the methodologies for aggregate analyses and the responsibilities of HAs. Addressing the regulatory discrepancies and harmonizing the safety surveillance processes at a global level would increase the usability of safety data accumulated by clinical studies worldwide, thus enabling and hopefully accelerating the development of safe and efficient drug therapies.",1,1,0,0,0
18556607,Adverse event detection in drug development: recommendations and obligations beyond phase 3.,"Premarketing studies of drugs, although large enough to demonstrate efficacy and detect common adverse events, cannot reliably detect an increased incidence of rare adverse events or events with significant latency. For most drugs, only about 500 to 3000 participants are studied, for relatively short durations, before a drug is marketed. Systems for assessment of postmarketing adverse events include spontaneous reports, computerized claims or medical record databases, and formal postmarketing studies. We briefly review the strengths and limitations of each. Postmarketing surveillance is essential for developing a full understanding of the balance between benefits and adverse effects. More work is needed in analysis of data from spontaneous reports of adverse effects and automated databases, design of ad hoc studies, and design of economically feasible large randomized studies.",1,0,0,0,0
11591227,Reporting of adverse drug reactions in randomised controlled trials - a systematic survey.,"Decisions on treatment are guided, not only by the potential for benefit, but also by the nature and severity of adverse drug reactions. However, some researchers have found numerous deficiencies in trial reports of adverse effects. We sought to confirm these findings by evaluating trials of drug therapy published in seven eminent medical journals in 1997. Literature review to determine whether the definition, recording and reporting of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials were in accordance with published recommendations on structured reporting. Of the 185 trials reviewed, 25 (14%) made no mention of adverse drug reactions. Data in a further 60 (32%) could not be fully evaluated, either because numbers were not given for each treatment arm (31 trials), or because a generic statement was made without full details (29 trials). When adverse drug reactions such as clinical events or patient symptoms were mentioned in the reports, details on how they had been recorded were given in only 14/95 (15%) and 18/104 (17%) trials respectively. Of the 86 trials that mentioned severity of adverse drug reactions, only 42 (49%) stated how severity had been defined. The median amount of space used for safety data in the Results and Discussion sections was 5.8%. Trial reports often failed to provide details on how adverse drug reactions were defined or recorded. The absence of such methodological information makes comparative evaluation of adverse reaction rates potentially unreliable. Authors and journals should adopt recommendations on the structured reporting of adverse effects.",1,0,0,0,0
21559325,Meta-analyses of adverse effects data derived from randomised controlled trials as compared to observational studies: methodological overview.,"There is considerable debate as to the relative merits of using randomised controlled trial (RCT) data as opposed to observational data in systematic reviews of adverse effects. This meta-analysis of meta-analyses aimed to assess the level of agreement or disagreement in the estimates of harm derived from meta-analysis of RCTs as compared to meta-analysis of observational studies. Searches were carried out in ten databases in addition to reference checking, contacting experts, citation searches, and hand-searching key journals, conference proceedings, and Web sites. Studies were included where a pooled relative measure of an adverse effect (odds ratio or risk ratio) from RCTs could be directly compared, using the ratio of odds ratios, with the pooled estimate for the same adverse effect arising from observational studies. Nineteen studies, yielding 58 meta-analyses, were identified for inclusion. The pooled ratio of odds ratios of RCTs compared to observational studies was estimated to be 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.15). There was less discrepancy with larger studies. The symmetric funnel plot suggests that there is no consistent difference between risk estimates from meta-analysis of RCT data and those from meta-analysis of observational studies. In almost all instances, the estimates of harm from meta-analyses of the different study designs had 95% confidence intervals that overlapped (54/58, 93%). In terms of statistical significance, in nearly two-thirds (37/58, 64%), the results agreed (both studies showing a significant increase or significant decrease or both showing no significant difference). In only one meta-analysis about one adverse effect was there opposing statistical significance. Empirical evidence from this overview indicates that there is no difference on average in the risk estimate of adverse effects of an intervention derived from meta-analyses of RCTs and meta-analyses of observational studies. This suggests that systematic reviews of adverse effects should not be restricted to specific study types. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.",1,0,0,0,0
22906139,Drug safety assessment in clinical trials: methodological challenges and opportunities.,"Randomized controlled trials are the principal means of establishing the efficacy of drugs. However pre-marketing trials are limited in size and duration and exclude high-risk populations. They have limited statistical power to detect rare but potentially serious adverse events in real-world patients. We summarize the principal methodological challenges in the reporting, analysis and interpretation of safety data in clinical trials using recent examples from systematic reviews. These challenges include the lack of an evidentiary gold standard, the limited statistical power of randomized controlled trials and resulting type 2 error, the lack of adequate ascertainment of adverse events and limited generalizability of trials that exclude high risk patients. We discuss potential solutions to these challenges. Evaluation of drug safety requires careful examination of data from heterogeneous sources. Meta-analyses of drug safety should include appropriate statistical methods and assess the optimal information size to avoid type 2 errors. They should evaluate outcome reporting biases and missing data to ensure reliable and accurate interpretation of findings. Regulatory and academic partnerships should be fostered to provide an independent and transparent evaluation of drug safety.",1,1,0,1,0
34954021,Improving the analysis of adverse event data in randomized controlled trials.,"Analyzing treatment harm is vital but problematic with the relatively small sample sizes afforded in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Good analysis practice for efficacy outcomes are well established but there has been minimal progress for the analysis of adverse events (AEs). In this commentary we examine four key issues for AE analysis. Namely, why harm data in RCTs is undervalued, why AE analysis is difficult, what aspects of current analysis practice are unsatisfactory, and the challenges for selection and interpretation of AEs results in publications. We discuss how the value of harm data from RCTs could be better realized by reframing the research question to one for detecting signals of adverse reactions. We align established good statistical practice to current unsatisfactory practice. We encourage use of Bayesian analyses to enable cumulative assessment of harm across trial research phases and discourage selecting AEs to report based on arbitrary rules. We propose comprehendible summaries to be based on core outcome sets, serious and pre-specified events, and events leading to discontinuation. Analysis of AEs in contemporary clinical trials needs attention to progress. In the following we have outlined immediate, mid and longer-term strategies for trialists to adopt to support a change in practice.",1,0,0,1,0
37580910,Identification of risk factors for adverse drug reactions in a pharmacovigilance database.,"In addition to identifying new safety signals, pharmacovigilance databases could be used to identify potential risk factors for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). To evaluate whether data mining in a pharmacovigilance database can be used to identify known and possible novel risk factors for ADRs, for use in pharmacovigilance practice. Exploratory data mining was performed within the Swedish national database of spontaneously reported ADRs. Bleeding associated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran-was used as a test model. We compared demographics, drug treatment, and clinical features between cases with bleeding (N = 965) and controls who had experienced other serious ADRs to DOACs (N = 511). Statistical analysis was performed by unadjusted and age adjusted logistic regression models, and the random forest based machine-learning method Boruta. In the logistic regression, 13 factors were significantly more common among cases of bleeding compared with controls. Eleven were labelled or previously proposed risk factors. Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation), hypertension, mental impairment disorders (e.g., dementia), renal and urinary tract procedures, gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation, and interacting drugs remained significant after adjustment for age. In the Boruta analysis, high age, arrhythmia, hypertension, cardiac failure, thromboembolism, and pharmacodynamically interacting drugs had a larger than random association with the outcome. High age, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, cardiac failure, and pharmacodynamically interacting drugs had odds ratios for bleeding above one, while thromboembolism had an odds ratio below one. We demonstrated that data mining within a pharmacovigilance database identifies known risk factors for DOAC bleeding, and potential risk factors such as dementia and atrial fibrillation. We propose that the method could be used in pharmacovigilance for identification of potential ADR risk factors that merit further evaluation.",1,0,1,0,0
30826796,Analysis and reporting of adverse events in randomised controlled trials: a review.,"To ascertain contemporary approaches to the collection, reporting and analysis of adverse events (AEs) in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a primary efficacy outcome. A review of clinical trials of drug interventions from four high impact medical journals. Electronic contents table of the <i>BMJ</i>, the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i>, the <i>Lancet</i> and the <i>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</i> were searched for reports of original RCTs published between September 2015 and September 2016. A prepiloted checklist was used and single data extraction was performed by three reviewers with independent check of a randomly sampled subset to verify quality. We extracted data on collection methods, assessment of severity and causality, reporting criteria, analysis methods and presentation of AE data. We identified 184 eligible reports (<i>BMJ</i> n=3; <i>JAMA</i> n=38, <i>Lancet</i> n=62 and <i>NEJM</i> n=81). Sixty-two per cent reported some form of spontaneous AE collection but only 29% included details of specific prompts used to ascertain AE data. Numbers that withdrew from the trial were well reported (80%), however only 35% of these reported whether withdrawals were due to AEs. Results presented and analysis performed was predominantly on 'patients with at least one event' with 84% of studies ignoring repeated events. Despite a lack of power to undertake formal hypothesis testing, 47% performed such tests for binary outcomes. This review highlighted that the collection, reporting and analysis of AE data in clinical trials is inconsistent and RCTs as a source of safety data are underused. Areas to improve include reducing information loss when analysing at patient level and inappropriate practice of underpowered multiple hypothesis testing. Implementation of standard reporting practices could enable a more accurate synthesis of safety data and development of guidance for statistical methodology to assess causality of AEs could facilitate better statistical practice.",1,0,0,0,0

To assess the incorporation of the CONSORT statement extension's recommendations in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating drug therapies published in high-impact medical journals. Using Medline, 122 RCTs published in 2009 were selected from BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM. A structured form was used to identify the harms information reported in the RCTs, following the recommendations of the CONSORT statement extension. The most frequently met CONSORT recommendation was the mention of harms in the title or abstract of the paper (72.1% of the papers analysed); the least-met recommendation was the reporting of how the harms information was collected (10.7%). The studies that focused on harms presented better information on safety, but only 10.8% met all recommendations in the CONSORT statement.

23713541,The detection of adverse events in randomized clinical trials: can we really say new medicines are safe?,"While it is well known that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually designed with sufficient sample size and power to detect the efficacy but not safety of a medicine, the extent to which RCTs quantify safety has not been well ascertained. The aim of this study was to assess the safety data available for five commonly prescribed medicines at the time of marketing. Published RCTs for five medicines risperidone, sertraline, donepezil, strontium ranelate and tramadol extended release were identified. All adverse events (AEs) in the trials were independently extracted by two clinical researchers. Using the sample size in the trials, the power to detect the observed difference in AEs rates between the treatment and placebo groups was calculated. A power of 80% or more was deemed adequate to detect AEs; studies with power of < 80% were deemed insufficiently powered to detect AEs. 12 RCTs were identified. Six trials were insufficiently powered to detect any of the potential AEs reported. Of the 150 evaluated AEs, the trials were insufficiently powered to detect 81% (122/150) of the AEs reported. For the adverse events that were detected with adequate powered clinical trials, only 53% (10/19) of potentially very common AEs (≥10%) and 17% (18/106) of potentially common AEs (1%-<10%) were identified. Trials are insufficiently powered to detect the majority of adverse events that are reported in clinical trials, even for common adverse events. Observations other than primary efficacy endpoints such as AEs that are not prespecified with adequate power should be treated as hypothesis generating only and not justification of evidence. Claims of safety based on trial evidence not designed for the safety endpoint are often premature.",1,0,0,0,0
15154826,Clinical pharmacology: special safety considerations in drug development and pharmacovigilance.,"The dose of a drug is a major determinant of its safety, and establishing a safe dose of a novel drug is a prime objective during clinical development. The design of pre-marketing clinical trials precludes the representation of important subpopulations such as children, the elderly and people with co-morbidities. Therefore, postmarketing surveillance (PMS) activities are required to monitor the safety profile of drugs in real clinical practice. Furthermore, individual variations in pharmacogenetic profiles, the immune system, drug metabolic pathways and drug-drug interactions are also important factors in the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. Thus, the safety of a drug is a major clinical consideration before and after it is marketed. A multidisciplinary approach is required to enhance the safety profile of drugs at all stages of development, including PMS activities. Clinical pharmacology encompasses a range of disciplines and forms the backbone of drug safety consideration during clinical drug development. In this review we give an overview of the clinical drug development process and consider its limitations. We present a discussion of several aspects of clinical pharmacology and their application to enhancing drug safety. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling provides a method of predicting a clinically safe dose; consideration of drug pharmacokinetics in special populations may enhance safe therapeutics in a wider spectrum of patients, while pharmacogenetics provides the possibility of genotype-specific therapeutics. Pharmacovigilance activities are also discussed. Given the complex nature and unpredictability of type B reactions, PMS activities are crucial in managing the risks drugs pose to the general population. The various aspects of clinical pharmacology discussed make a strong case for this field as the backbone of optimising and promoting safe development and use of drugs.",0,1,0,1,0
27301048,Under-reporting of harm in clinical trials.,"Appropriate safety evaluations of anticancer drugs are crucial to assess their benefit-risk ratio. Substantial evidence shows that clinicians under-report harm in clinical trials, and at least three factors contribute to this problem: assessment of harm by clinicians might not represent the experience of patients; harm might be detected within trials, but is not reported appropriately by investigators or reporting is influenced by sponsors; and short-term follow-up might not detect long-term and potentially serious toxicities. Additionally, because of the selection of patients with good functional status in clinical trials, study results might not apply to patients treated in everyday clinical practice. New approaches for the conduct, oversight, and reporting of clinical trials should include patient-reported assessment of side-effects. Effective pharmacovigilance programmes and large-scale observational studies are needed to improve understanding of the tolerability of anticancer drugs in a real world setting.",1,0,0,0,0
33258698,Meta-analysis of rare adverse events in randomized clinical trials: Bayesian and frequentist methods.,"Regulatory approval of a drug or device involves an assessment of not only the benefits but also the risks of adverse events associated with the therapeutic agent. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness, the number of treated patients in a single RCT may not be enough to detect a rare but serious side effect of the treatment. Meta-analysis plays an important role in the evaluation of the safety of medical products and has advantage over analyzing a single RCT when estimating the rate of adverse events. In this article, we compare 15 widely used meta-analysis models under both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks when outcomes are extremely infrequent or rare. We present extensive simulation study results and then apply these methods to a real meta-analysis that considers RCTs investigating the effect of rosiglitazone on the risks of myocardial infarction and of death from cardiovascular causes. Our simulation studies suggest that the beta hyperprior method modeling treatment group-specific parameters and accounting for heterogeneity performs the best. Most models ignoring between-study heterogeneity give poor coverage probability when such heterogeneity exists. In the data analysis, different methods provide a wide range of log odds ratio estimates between rosiglitazone and control treatments with a mixed conclusion on their statistical significance based on 95% confidence (or credible) intervals. In the rare event setting, treatment effect estimates obtained from traditional meta-analytic methods may be biased and provide poor coverage probability. This trend worsens when the data have large between-study heterogeneity. In general, we recommend methods that first estimate the summaries of treatment-specific risks across studies and then relative treatment effects based on the summaries when appropriate. Furthermore, we recommend fitting various methods, comparing the results and model performance, and investigating any significant discrepancies among them.",1,0,0,1,0
26679963,A Drug Safety Rating System Based on Postmarketing Costs Associated with Adverse Events and Patient Outcomes.,"Given the multiple limitations associated with relatively homogeneous preapproval clinical trials, inadequate data disclosures, slow reaction times from regulatory bodies, and deep-rooted bias against disclosing and publishing negative results, there is an acute need for the development of analytics that reflect drug safety in heterogeneous, real-world populations. To develop a drug safety statistic that estimates downstream medical costs associated with serious adverse events (AEs) and unfavorable patient outcomes associated with the use of 706 FDA-approved drugs. All primary suspect case reports for each drug were collected from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS) from 2010-2014. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was used to code serious AEs and outcomes, which were tallied for each case report. Medical costs associated with AEs and poor patient outcomes were derived from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) survey data, and their corresponding ICD-9-CM codes were mapped to MedDRA terms. Nonserious AEs and outcomes were not included. For each case report, either the highest AE cost or, if no eligible AE was listed, the highest outcome cost was used. All costed cases were aggregated for each drug and divided by the number of patients exposed to obtain a downstream estimated direct medical cost burden per exposure. Each drug was assigned a corresponding 1-100 point total. The 706 drugs showed an exponential distribution of downstream costs, and the data were transformed using the natural log to approximate a normal distribution. The minimum score was 8.29, and the maximum score was 99.25, with a mean of 44.32. Drugs with the highest individual scores tended to be kinase inhibitors, thalidomide analogs, and endothelin receptor antagonists. When scores were analyzed across Established Pharmacologic Class (EPC), the kinase inhibitor and endothelin receptor antagonist classes had the highest total. However, other EPCs with median scores of 75 and above included hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor, recombinant human interferon beta, vascular endothelial growth factor-directed antibody, and tumor necrosis factor blocker. When Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications were analyzed, antineoplastic drugs were outliers with approximately 80% of their individual scores 60 and above, while approximately 20%-30% of blood and anti-infective drugs had scores of 60 and above. Within-drug class results served to differentiate similar drugs. For example, 6 serotonin reuptake inhibitors had a score range of 35 to 53. This scoring system is based on estimated direct medical costs associated with postmarketing AEs and poor patient outcomes and thereby helps fill a large information gap regarding drug safety in real-world patient populations.",1,1,0,0,0
37855974,A Novel Method for Deriving Adverse Event Prevalence in Randomized Controlled Trials: Potential for Improved Understanding of Benefit-Risk Ratio and Application to Drug Labels.,"Adverse event (AE) data in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allow quantification of a drug's safety risk relative to placebo and comparison across medications. The standard US label for Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs typically lists AEs by MedDRA Preferred Term that occur at ≥ 2% in drug and with greater incidence than in placebo. We suggest that the drug label can be more informative for both patients and physicians if it includes, in addition to AE incidence (percent of subjects who reported the AE out of the total subjects in treatment), the absolute prevalence (percent of subject-days spent with an AE out of the total subject-days spent in treatment) and expected duration (days required for AE incidence to be reduced by half). We also propose a new method to analyze AEs in RCTs using drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence to improve safety signal detection. AE data from six RCTs in schizophrenia were analyzed (five RCTs of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor-based antipsychotic lurasidone and one RCT of the novel trace amine-associated receptor 1 [TAAR1] agonist ulotaront). We determined incidence, absolute prevalence, and expected duration of AEs for lurasidone and ulotaront vs respective placebo. We also calculated areas under the curve of drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence and mean percent contribution of each AE to this difference. A number of AEs with the same incidence had different absolute prevalence and expected duration. When accounting for these two parameters, AEs that did not appear in the 2% incidence tables of the drug label turned out to contribute substantially to drug tolerability. The percent contribution of a drug-related AE to the overall side effect burden increased the drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence, whereas the percent contribution of a placebo-related AE decreased such difference, revealing a continuum of risk between drug and placebo. AE prevalence curves for drug were generally greater than those for placebo. Ulotaront exhibited a small drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence curves due to a relatively low incidence and short duration of AEs in the ulotaront treatment arm as well as the emergence of disease-related AEs in the placebo arm. Reporting AE absolute prevalence and expected duration for each RCT and incorporating them in the drug label is possible, is clinically relevant, and allows standardized comparison of medications. Our new metric, the drug-placebo difference in AE prevalence, facilitates signal detection in RCTs. We piloted this metric in RCTs of several neuropsychiatric indications and drugs, offering a new way to compare AE burden and tolerability among treatments using existing clinical trial information.",1,0,0,1,0
34611721,Medication-related adverse events in health care-what have we learned? A narrative overview of the current knowledge.,"Although medication-related adverse events (MRAEs) in health care are vastly studied, high heterogeneity in study results complicates the interpretations of the current situation. The main objective of this study was to form an up-to-date overview of the current knowledge of the prevalence, risk factors, and surveillance of MRAEs in health care. Electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched with applicable search terms to collect information on medication-related adverse events. In order to obtain an up-to-date view of MRAEs, only studies published after 2000 were accepted. The prevalence rates of different MRAEs vary greatly between individual studies and meta-analyses. Study setting, patient population, and detection methods play an important role in determining detection rates, which should be regarded while interpreting the results. Medication-related adverse events are more common in elderly patients and patients with lowered liver or kidney function, polypharmacy, and a large number of additional comorbidities. However, the risk of MRAEs is also significantly increased by the use of high-risk medicines but also in certain care situations. Preventing MRAEs is important as it will decrease patient mortality and morbidity but also reduce costs and functional challenges related to them. Medication-related adverse events are highly common and have both immediate and long-term effects to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Conclusive solutions for prevention of all medication-related harm are impossible to create. In the future, however, the development of efficient real-time detection methods can provide significant improvements for event prevention and forecasting.",1,0,0,0,0
35214773,Adverse Events Reporting Quality of Randomized Controlled Trials of COVID-19 Vaccine Using the CONSORT Criteria for Reporting Harms: A Systematic Review.,"Assessing the quality of evidence from vaccine clinical trials is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and further enhance public acceptance. This study aims to summarize and critically evaluate the quality of harm reporting on randomized controlled trials for the COVID-19 vaccine and determine the factors associated with reporting quality. We systematically searched the literature using PRISMA guidelines for randomized controlled trials (RCT) on COVID-19 Vaccine until 30 December 2021. Published articles were searched from electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Bibliovid. Bias analysis was performed using RoB-2 tools. The quality of reporting was assessed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harm extension modified into 21 items. A total of 61 RCT studies (402,014 patients) were analyzed. Over half the studies demonstrated adequate reporting (59.02%), and 21 studies (34.4%) reported a low risk of bias. All studies reported death and serious adverse events (AEs), but only six studies mentioned how to handle the recurrent AEs. Reporting of AEs in subgroup analysis was also poor (25%). The RCTs on the COVID-19 vaccine were less biased with good quality on reporting harm based on the modified CONSORT harm extension. However, study quality must be considered, especially for a balance of information between effectivity and safety.",1,0,0,0,0
29785683,Targeted therapies and adverse drug reactions in oncology: the role of clinical pharmacist in pharmacovigilance.,"Background The majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) are based on pivotal clinical trials, performed under controlled conditions and with selected patients. Objectives (1) to observe ADRs in the real-world setting and to evaluate if the supervision of the pharmacist impacts on the management of ADRs and on the satisfaction of patients; (2) to sensitise health professionals and patients on the need to increase the reporting of ADRs, in compliance with Pharmacovigilance. Setting CRO Aviano, Italian National Cancer Institute. Method From February 2013 to April 2015, we conducted an observational study enrolling 154 patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing treatment with at least one of ten targeted-therapies included in the study. Main outcome ADR reporting in the real-world setting. Patient satisfaction with clinical pharmacist support. Results Reported ADRs in the real setting do not always correspond with data described in the respective SPCs. Unknown ADRs were also identified such as hyperglycaemia with lenalidomide and sorafenib; and hypomagnesaemia with bevacizumab. We also observed a 124.3% increase in spontaneous reports. Conclusion This study shows the high value of active pharmacovigilance programs, and our results might be a starting point for developing a randomised trial which should aim to demonstrate the impact of the pharmacist on improving patient's adherence and in measuring the difference in ADRs reports in the different arms followed or not by the pharmacist.",1,0,0,1,0
20183450,Statistical methods to analyze adverse events data of randomized clinical trials.,"The adverse events data of randomized clinical trials are often analyzed based on either crude incidence rates or exposure-adjusted incidence rates. These rates do not adequately account for an individual patient's profile of adverse events over the study period when an individual may remain in the trial after experiencing one or more events (i.e., occurrence of multiple events of the same kind or different kinds). Moreover, the required statistical assumptions (e.g., constant hazard rate over time) for valid estimates of incidence rates are not likely to be met in practice by adverse events data of clinical trials. A nonparametric approach called the mean cumulative function (MCF) provides a valid statistical inference on recurrent adverse event profiles of drugs in randomized clinical trials. The estimate involves no assumptions about the form of MCF. To demonstrate the applicability and utility of the MCF approach in clinical trial datasets, an adverse event dataset obtained from a clinical trial is analyzed in this article. As compared to the crude or exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events, the MCF estimates facilitate more understanding of safety profiles of a drug in a randomized clinical trial.",1,0,0,1,0
25083202,Comprehensive evaluations of the adverse effects of drugs: importance of appropriate study selection and data sources.,"While systematic reviews and meta-analyses are at the top of the evidence hierarchy, most of the methodology has focused on assessing treatment benefit. Hence, we propose a structured framework for the initial steps of searching and identifying relevant data sources so that adverse effects can be evaluated in a comprehensive, unbiased manner. The unique methodological challenges stem from the difficulties of addressing diverse outcomes encompassing common, mild symptoms to rare, fatal events. Retrieval of the most appropriate studies should be specifically tailored to fit the nature of the adverse effects, according to the primary objective and study question. In our framework, the structure of the review takes different forms depending on whether the main aim is on scoping/hypothesis generation, or evaluating statistically the magnitude of risk (hypothesis testing), or clarifying characteristics and risk factors of the adverse effect. The wide range of data sources covering adverse effects all have distinct strengths and limitations, and selection of appropriate sources depends on characteristics of the adverse effect (e.g. background incidence and effect size of the drug, clinical presentation, time of onset after drug exposure). Reviewers need to retrieve particular study designs that are most likely to yield robust data on the adverse effects of interest, rather than rely on studies that cannot reliably detect adverse effects, and may yield 'false negatives'. Type II errors (a particular problem when evaluating rare adverse effects) can lull us into a false sense of security (e.g. wrongly concluding that there was no significant difference in harm between drug and control, with the drug erroneously judged as safe). Given the rapid rate at which methodological improvements occur, this proposed framework is by no means definitive, but aims to stimulate further debate and discussion amongst the pharmacoepidemiological and systematic review communities to reach a common consensus on the best methods.",1,0,0,1,0
40433303,Patients prefer easy adverse event reporting: Observational study within clinical trial.,"Digital intervention safety is crucial for regulatory approval and clinical adoption. However, the evaluation and reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials are often insufficient. Digital qualitative self-reporting could enhance the detection of AEs, but patient preferences for using such channels remain understudied. This observational study was conducted in Finland between 2022 and 2024 within a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of <i>Meliora</i>, a game-based digital intervention for patients living with major depressive disorder. We assessed the preferences of 1001 patients for self-reporting AEs across four channels: a prompted, within-intervention questionnaire (CORTO: Contextual, One-item, Repeated, Timely, Open-ended), a Jira questionnaire, email, and phone. 148 (14.8%) patients reported AEs during the study. We found a significant imbalance between the channels: 11.3% (<i>n</i> = 113) of patients reported AEs using CORTO, 4.1% (<i>n</i> = 41) using email, 1.1% (<i>n</i> = 11) using Jira, and 0.4% (<i>n</i> = 4) using phone. These findings reveal that patients prefer low-effort methods for reporting AEs and are more likely to report AEs via a prompted, within-intervention questionnaire (CORTO) than through other methods. Integrating qualitative self-report channels into digital interventions may enhance AE detection rates, improve clinical trial safety monitoring, and support post-market surveillance.",1,0,0,0,0
37779893,Quality of reporting of adverse events in clinical trials of covid-19 drugs: systematic review.,"To assess the quality of reporting of adverse events in clinical trials of covid-19 drugs based on the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) harms extension and according to clinical trial design, and to examine reporting of serious adverse events in drug trials published on PubMed versus clinical trial summaries on ClinicalTrials.gov. Systematic review. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov registries were searched from 1 December 2019 to 17 February 2022. Randomised clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs used to treat covid-19 disease in participants of all ages with suspected, probable, or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Clinical trials were screened on title, abstract, and text by two authors independently. Only articles published in French and English were selected. The Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) was used to assess risk of bias. The search strategy identified 1962 randomised clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of drugs used to treat covid-19, published in the PubMed database; 1906 articles were excluded after screening and 56 clinical trials were included in the review. Among the 56 clinical trials, no study had a high score for quality of reporting of adverse events, 60.7% had a moderate score, 33.9% had a low score, and 5.4% had a very low score. All clinical trials with a very low score for quality of reporting of adverse events were randomised open label trials. For reporting of serious adverse events, journal articles published on PubMed under-reported 51% of serious adverse events compared with clinical trial summaries published on ClinicalTrials.gov. In one in three published clinical trials on covid-19 drugs, the quality of reporting of adverse events was low or very low. Differences were found in the number of serious adverse events reported in journal articles versus clinical trial summaries. During the covid-19 pandemic, risk assessment of drugs in clinical trials of covid-19 drugs did not comply with good practice recommendations for publication of results.

24228998,"Incidence, characteristics and risk factors of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized children - a prospective observational cohort study of 6,601 admissions.","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important cause of harm in children. Current data are incomplete due to methodological differences between studies: only half of all studies provide drug data, incidence rates vary (0.6% to 16.8%) and very few studies provide data on causality, severity and risk factors of pediatric ADRs. We aimed to determine the incidence of ADRs in hospitalized children, to characterize these ADRs in terms of type, drug etiology, causality and severity and to identify risk factors. We undertook a year-long, prospective observational cohort study of admissions to a single UK pediatric medical and surgical secondary and tertiary referral center (Alder Hey, Liverpool, UK). Children between 0 and 16 years 11 months old and admitted for more than 48 hours were included. Observed outcomes were occurrence of ADR and time to first ADR for the risk factor analysis. A total of 5,118 children (6,601 admissions) were included, 17.7% of whom experienced at least one ADR. Opiate analgesics and drugs used in general anesthesia (GA) accounted for more than 50% of all drugs implicated in ADRs. Of these ADRs, 0.9% caused permanent harm or required admission to a higher level of care. Children who underwent GA were at more than six times the risk of developing an ADR than children without a GA (hazard ratio (HR) 6.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.30 to 7.70). Other factors increasing the risk of an ADR were increasing age (HR 1.06 for each year; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.07), increasing number of drugs (HR 1.25 for each additional drug; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.28) and oncological treatment (HR 1.90; 95% CI 1.40 to 2.60). ADRs are common in hospitalized children and children who had undergone a GA had more than six times the risk of developing an ADR. GA agents and opiate analgesics are a significant cause of ADRs and have been underrepresented in previous studies. This is a concern in view of the increasing number of pediatric short-stay surgeries.",1,0,1,0,0
29685700,Randomized clinical trials and observational studies in the assessment of drug safety.,"Randomized clinical trials are considered as the preferred design to assess the potential causal relationships between drugs or other medical interventions and intended effects. For this reason, randomized clinical trials are generally the basis of development programs in the life cycle of drugs and the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. Instead, randomized clinical trials are not the design of choice for the detection and assessment of rare, delayed and/or unexpected effects related to drug safety. Moreover, the highly homogeneous populations resulting from restrictive eligibility criteria make randomized clinical trials inappropriate to describe comprehensively the safety profile of drugs. In that context, observational studies have a key added value when evaluating the benefit-risk balance of the drugs. However, observational studies are more prone to bias than randomized clinical trials and they have to be designed, conducted and reported judiciously. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of randomized clinical trials and of observational studies, more particularly regarding their contribution to the knowledge of medicines' safety profile. In addition, we present general recommendations for the sensible use of observational data.",1,0,0,0,0
27112273,Individualized versus standardized risk assessment in patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions (IDrug) - study protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to adverse drug reactions, especially if they are affected by additional risk factors such as multimorbidity, polypharmacy, impaired renal function and intake of drugs with high risk potential. Apart from these clinical parameters, drug safety and efficacy can be influenced by pharmacogenetic factors. Evidence-based recommendations concerning drug-gene-combinations have been issued by international consortia and in drug labels. However, clinical benefit of providing information on individual patient factors in a comprehensive risk assessment aiming to reduce the occurrence and severity of adverse drug reactions is not evident. Purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of a concise individual risk information leaflet with standard information on risk factors for side effects. The trial was designed as a prospective, two-arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter, pragmatic study. 960 elderly, multimorbid outpatients in general medicine are included if they take at least one high risk and one other long-term drug (polymedication). As high risk ""index drugs"" oral anticoagulants and antiplatelets were chosen because of their specific, objectively assessable side effects. Following randomization, test group patients receive an individualized risk assessment leaflet evaluating their personal data concerning bleeding- and thromboembolic-risk-scores, potential drug-drug-interactions, age, renal function and pharmacogenetic factors. Control group patients obtain a standardized leaflet only containing general information on these criteria. Follow-up period is 9 months for each patient. Primary endpoint is the occurrence of a thromboembolic/bleeding event or death. Secondary endpoints are other adverse drug reactions, hospital admissions, specialist referrals and medication changes due to adverse drug reactions, the patients' adherence to medication regimen as well as health related quality of life, mortality and resulting costs. Despite extensive evidence of risk factors for adverse drug reactions, there are few prospective trial data about an individualized risk assessment including pharmacogenetic information to increase patient safety. By conducting a health economic analysis, we will evaluate if the application of an individualized drug therapy in daily routine is cost-effective.

35125905,Incidence and risk factors of adverse drug reactions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A pharmacovigilance experience utilizing an ADR trigger tool.,"Since the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic, most countries started treating their patients with various therapies. However, the data regarding their safety and effectiveness is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) incidence and their predisposing factors among COVID-19 patients. A retrospective observational study that was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital from March - June 2020. Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years old, inpatient, had a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for COVID-19, and were treated with; (lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, ribavirin, or interferon-ß) either as monotherapy or combination therapy for three days or longer. The data of eligible patients were retrieved from the electronic medical records. A standardized data collection form was designed to collect patient demographics, COVID-19 severity based on the Saudi Ministry of Health management protocols, antiviral therapies, duration of therapy, and length of stay (LOS). The ADRs were identified via conducting a comprehensive review using predefined triggers and were evaluated using Naranjo Score. A total of 155 patients were included of which 123 (79.4%) were males. In our sample, the incidence proportion of ADRs per patient was 72.3%. A total of 287 ADRs were identified most of them were hepatic (n = <b>101</b>, 35.2%), gastrointestinal (n = <b>59</b>, 20.6%), hematological (n = <b>47</b>, 16%), and endocrine (n = <b>45</b>, 15%). Hydroxychloroquine was the most common drug associated with ADRs (n = <b>155</b>). The length of stay (10 - 20 days) was the only statistically significant with the ADR incidence (p-value = 0.008; 95 %CI 1.216:3.568). The ADRs are prevalent among COVID-19 patients, which assure the importance of implementing active hospital-based pharmacovigilance systems.",1,0,1,0,0
39470185,Improving adverse drug event reporting by healthcare professionals.,"Adverse drug events, encompassing both adverse drug reactions and medication errors, pose a significant threat to health, leading to illness and, in severe cases, death. Timely and voluntary reporting of adverse drug events by healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in mitigating the morbidity and mortality linked to unexpected reactions and improper medication usage. To assess the effectiveness of different interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to improve the reporting of adverse drug events. We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE and several other electronic databases and trials registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, from inception until 14 October 2022. We also screened reference lists in the included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised trials, non-randomised controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (ITS) and repeated measures studies, assessing the effect of any intervention aimed at healthcare professionals and designed to increase adverse drug event reporting. Eligible comparators were healthcare professionals' usual reporting practice or a different intervention or interventions designed to improve adverse drug event reporting rate. We excluded studies of interventions targeted at adverse event reporting following immunisation. Our primary outcome measures were the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) and the number of false adverse drug event reports (encompassing both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) submitted by healthcare professionals. Secondary outcomes were the number of serious, high-causality, unexpected or previously unknown, and new drug-related adverse drug event reports submitted by healthcare professionals. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We extracted and reanalysed ITS study data and imputed treatment effect estimates (including standard errors or confidence intervals) for the randomised studies. We included 15 studies (eight RCTs, six ITS, and one non-randomised cross-over study) with approximately 62,389 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries in large tertiary care hospitals. There was a high risk of performance bias in the controlled studies due to the nature of the interventions. None of the ITS studies had a control arm, so we could not be sure of the detected effects being independent of other changes. None of the studies reported on the number of false adverse drug event reports submitted. There is low-certainty evidence suggesting that an education session, together with reminder card and adverse drug reaction (ADR) report form, may substantially improve the rate of ADR reporting by healthcare professionals when compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting with or without some training provided by regional pharmacosurveillance units). These educational interventions increased the number of ADR reports in total (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.90; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), serious ADR reports (RR 3.30, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.21; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), high-causality ADR reports (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.57; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), unexpected ADR reports (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.75 to 12.76; 4 studies, 15,085 participants) and new drug-related ADR reports (RR 8.68, 95% CI 3.40 to 22.13; 2 studies, 7884 participants). Additionally, low-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting), making it easier to report ADRs by using a standardised discharge form with added ADR items may slightly improve the total number of ADR reports submitted (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.83; 1 study, 5967 participants). The discharge form tested was based on the 'Diagnosis Related Groups' (DRG) system for recording patient diagnoses, and the medical and surgical procedures received during their hospital stay. Due to very low-certainty evidence, we do not know if the following interventions have any effect on the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both ADR and ME reports) submitted by healthcare professionals: - sending informational letters or emails to GPs and nurses; - multifaceted interventions, including financial and non-financial incentives, fines, education and reminder cards; - implementing government regulations together with financial incentives; - including ADR report forms in quarterly bulletins and prescription pads; - providing a hyperlink to the reporting form in hospitals' electronic patient records; - improving the reporting method by re-engineering a web-based electronic error reporting system; - the presence of a clinical pharmacist in a hospital setting actively identifying adverse drug events and advocating for the identification and reporting of adverse drug events. Compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting with or without some training from regional pharmacosurveillance units), low-certainty evidence suggests that the number of ADR reports submitted may substantially increase following an education session, paired with reminder card and ADR report form, and may slightly increase with the use of a standardised discharge form method that makes it easier for healthcare professionals to report ADRs. The evidence for other interventions identified in this review, such as informational letters or emails and financial incentives, is uncertain. Future studies need to assess the benefits (increase in the number of adverse drug event reports) and harms (increase in the number of false adverse drug event reports) of any intervention designed to improve healthcare professionals' reporting of adverse drug events. Interventions to increase the number of submitted adverse drug event reports that are suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries should be developed and rigorously evaluated.",1,0,0,0,0
10849925,Risk factors for the development of adverse drug events in hospitalized patients.,"Adverse drug events in hospitalized patients lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Early detection of adverse drug events could aid in the prevention of these adverse outcomes. A cost-effective system for the early detection of adverse drug events should focus on high risk patients. A study was set up with the primary aim to identify characteristics that are associated with the development of adverse drug events (ADEs) in hospitalized patients. ADE reports were gathered from physicians and nurses (spontaneous reports) and from patients after intensive ward interviews by hospital pharmacists. All patients admitted to the internal medicine wards of two Dutch hospitals, during a two month period, were included. The following characteristics were analyzed for their potential relationship to the occurrence of ADEs: age (categorized), gender, number of drugs prescribed during hospital stay, types of drugs used and changes in drug use on admission. Age was found to be inversely associated with the development of ADEs (OR 0.36, CI 0.21-0.61 for age category > 80 years; OR 0.56; CI 0.31-1.02 for age category 75-80 years and OR 0.69; CI 0.42-1.11 for age category 60-74 years). Furthermore, statistically significant associations were found for the number of drugs prescribed per hospitalized patient (for the class of 4-6 drugs per patient OR 2.61, CI 1.32-5.18), for newly prescribed drugs (OR 6.65, CI 2.63-16.81) and for the cessation of drugs on hospital admission (OR 1.50, CI 1.02-2.20). The use of gastrointestinal drugs (OR 2.13, CI 1.32-3.45), central nervous system drugs (OR 1.66, CI 1.07-2.57) and antibiotics (OR 2.44, CI 1.65-3.60) were associated with the development of ADEs, when compared to all other drugs taken by the patients. In this study, the most important risk factors are the number of drugs used per patient and the starting of a new drug during hospitalization. As most hospitalized patients start new drug therapies while in hospital, this seems an inappropriate focus. However, careful monitoring of patients using more than 7 drugs at a time may be possible in a cost-effective system for the early detection of ADEs.",1,0,1,0,0
26350571,Risks of phase I research with healthy participants: A systematic review.,"Tragedies suggest that phase I trials in healthy participants may be highly risky. This possibility raises concern that phase I trials may exploit healthy participants to develop new therapies, making the translation of scientific discoveries ethically worrisome. Yet, few systematic data evaluate this concern. This article systematically reviews the risks of published phase I trials in healthy participants and evaluates trial features associated with increased risks. Data on adverse events and trial characteristics were extracted from all phase I trials published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and PsycINFO (1 January 2008-1 October 2012). Inclusion criteria were phase I studies that enrolled healthy participants of any age, provided quantitative adverse event data, and documented the number of participants enrolled. Exclusion criteria included (1) adverse event data not in English, (2) a ""challenge"" study in which participants were administered a pathogen, and (3) no quantitative information about serious adverse events. Data on the incidence of adverse events, duration of adverse event monitoring, trial agent tested, participant demographics, and trial location were extracted. In 475 trials enrolling 27,185 participants, there was a median of zero serious adverse events (interquartile range = 0-0) and a median of zero severe adverse events (interquartile range = 0-0) per 1000 treatment group participants/day of monitoring. The rate of mild and moderate adverse events was a median of 1147.19 per 1000 participants (interquartile range = 651.52-1730.9) and 46.07 per 1000 participants/adverse event monitoring day (interquartile range = 17.80-77.19). We conclude that phase I trials do cause mild and moderate harms but pose low risks of severe harm. To ensure that this conclusion also applies to unpublished trials, it is important to increase trial transparency.",1,1,0,0,0
37020083,Safety Surveillance During Drug Development: Comparative Evaluation of Existing Regulations.,"Drug safety monitoring is essential for developing efficient and safe treatments. It starts with preclinical toxicology studies and continues with the observation and analysis of potentially harmful effects in humans throughout the whole drug life cycle. Safety surveillance during the clinical phase is of paramount importance for protecting the health of clinical trial (CT) participants at a period when relatively little is known about the drug safety profile, and for reassuring that detected risks are minimized when the product obtains marketing approval. This review aimed to investigate current safety surveillance methods during drug development worldwide, in order to identify potential gaps and opportunities for amelioration. To this end, international guidelines, standards, and local legislations about CTs were reviewed and compared. Our review revealed common strategies, mainly in alignment with international guidelines, especially concerning the systematic collection, assessment, and expedition of adverse events by investigators and sponsors and the preparation of periodic aggregate safety reports by sponsors, as a means to inform health authorities (HAs) about the evolving benefit-risk balance of the investigational product. Inconsistencies in safety surveillance mainly concerned local expedited reporting requirements. Significant gaps were identified in the methodologies for aggregate analyses and the responsibilities of HAs. Addressing the regulatory discrepancies and harmonizing the safety surveillance processes at a global level would increase the usability of safety data accumulated by clinical studies worldwide, thus enabling and hopefully accelerating the development of safe and efficient drug therapies.",1,1,0,0,0
18556607,Adverse event detection in drug development: recommendations and obligations beyond phase 3.,"Premarketing studies of drugs, although large enough to demonstrate efficacy and detect common adverse events, cannot reliably detect an increased incidence of rare adverse events or events with significant latency. For most drugs, only about 500 to 3000 participants are studied, for relatively short durations, before a drug is marketed. Systems for assessment of postmarketing adverse events include spontaneous reports, computerized claims or medical record databases, and formal postmarketing studies. We briefly review the strengths and limitations of each. Postmarketing surveillance is essential for developing a full understanding of the balance between benefits and adverse effects. More work is needed in analysis of data from spontaneous reports of adverse effects and automated databases, design of ad hoc studies, and design of economically feasible large randomized studies.",1,0,0,0,0
11591227,Reporting of adverse drug reactions in randomised controlled trials - a systematic survey.,"Decisions on treatment are guided, not only by the potential for benefit, but also by the nature and severity of adverse drug reactions. However, some researchers have found numerous deficiencies in trial reports of adverse effects. We sought to confirm these findings by evaluating trials of drug therapy published in seven eminent medical journals in 1997. Literature review to determine whether the definition, recording and reporting of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials were in accordance with published recommendations on structured reporting. Of the 185 trials reviewed, 25 (14%) made no mention of adverse drug reactions. Data in a further 60 (32%) could not be fully evaluated, either because numbers were not given for each treatment arm (31 trials), or because a generic statement was made without full details (29 trials). When adverse drug reactions such as clinical events or patient symptoms were mentioned in the reports, details on how they had been recorded were given in only 14/95 (15%) and 18/104 (17%) trials respectively. Of the 86 trials that mentioned severity of adverse drug reactions, only 42 (49%) stated how severity had been defined. The median amount of space used for safety data in the Results and Discussion sections was 5.8%. Trial reports often failed to provide details on how adverse drug reactions were defined or recorded. The absence of such methodological information makes comparative evaluation of adverse reaction rates potentially unreliable. Authors and journals should adopt recommendations on the structured reporting of adverse effects.",1,0,0,0,0
21559325,Meta-analyses of adverse effects data derived from randomised controlled trials as compared to observational studies: methodological overview.,"There is considerable debate as to the relative merits of using randomised controlled trial (RCT) data as opposed to observational data in systematic reviews of adverse effects. This meta-analysis of meta-analyses aimed to assess the level of agreement or disagreement in the estimates of harm derived from meta-analysis of RCTs as compared to meta-analysis of observational studies. Searches were carried out in ten databases in addition to reference checking, contacting experts, citation searches, and hand-searching key journals, conference proceedings, and Web sites. Studies were included where a pooled relative measure of an adverse effect (odds ratio or risk ratio) from RCTs could be directly compared, using the ratio of odds ratios, with the pooled estimate for the same adverse effect arising from observational studies. Nineteen studies, yielding 58 meta-analyses, were identified for inclusion. The pooled ratio of odds ratios of RCTs compared to observational studies was estimated to be 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.15). There was less discrepancy with larger studies. The symmetric funnel plot suggests that there is no consistent difference between risk estimates from meta-analysis of RCT data and those from meta-analysis of observational studies. In almost all instances, the estimates of harm from meta-analyses of the different study designs had 95% confidence intervals that overlapped (54/58, 93%). In terms of statistical significance, in nearly two-thirds (37/58, 64%), the results agreed (both studies showing a significant increase or significant decrease or both showing no significant difference). In only one meta-analysis about one adverse effect was there opposing statistical significance. Empirical evidence from this overview indicates that there is no difference on average in the risk estimate of adverse effects of an intervention derived from meta-analyses of RCTs and meta-analyses of observational studies. This suggests that systematic reviews of adverse effects should not be restricted to specific study types. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.",1,0,0,0,0
36630140,Efficacy and Safety of Lebrikizumab in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids in Adolescents and Adults With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial (ADhere).,"Lebrikizumab (LEB), a high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-13, demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) during 16 weeks of monotherapy in a phase 2b trial, and two 52-week phase 3 trials. To evaluate efficacy and safety of LEB combined with low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The ADhere trial was a 16-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo (PBO)-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial conducted from February 3, 2020, to September 16, 2021. The study was conducted at 54 outpatient sites across Germany, Poland, Canada, and the US and included adolescent (aged ≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) and adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The treatment allocation ratio was 2:1 (LEB:PBO). Overall, 211 patients were randomized to subcutaneous LEB (loading dose of 500 mg at baseline and week 2, followed by 250 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W] thereafter) or PBO Q2W in combination with TCS for 16 weeks. Efficacy analyses at week 16 included proportions of patients achieving Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (IGA [0,1]) with 2 or more points improvement from baseline, and 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75). Key secondary end points included evaluation of itch, itch interference on sleep, and quality of life. Safety assessments included monitoring adverse events (AEs). The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.2 (19.3) years, 103 (48.8%) patients were women, 31 (14.7%) patients were Asian, and 28 (13.3%) patients were Black/African American. At week 16, IGA (0,1) was achieved by 145 (41.2%) patients in the LEB+TCS group vs 66 (22.1%) receiving PBO+TCS (P = .01); corresponding proportions of patients achieving EASI-75 were 69.5% vs 42.2% (P < .001). The LEB+TCS group showed statistically significant improvements in all key secondary end points. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nonserious, mild or moderate in severity, and did not lead to study discontinuation. The TEAEs frequently reported in the LEB+TCS group included conjunctivitis (7 [4.8%]), headache (7 [4.8%]), hypertension (4 [2.8%]), injection site reactions (4 [2.8%]), and herpes infection (5 [3.4%]) vs 1.5% or less patient-reported frequencies in the PBO+TCS group. Similar frequencies of patient-reported serious AEs following LEB+TCS (n = 2, 1.4%) and PBO+TCS (n = 1, 1.5%). In this randomized phase 3 clinical trial, LEB+TCS was associated with improved outcomes in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe AD compared with TCS alone, and safety was consistent with previously reported AD trials.

38476099,"Pharmacokinetics and safety of erenumab in pediatric patients with migraine: A phase I, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose study.","Erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is efficacious and safe for prevention of attacks of migraine in adults. This phase I, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of erenumab in children and adolescents with migraine. The initial treatment phase lasted 12 weeks, followed by an optional 40-week extension phase for adolescents. Primary end points were PK of erenumab, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and changes in clinical and laboratory assessments. Participants received erenumab 35 mg (n = 4), 70 mg (n = 17), or 140 mg (n = 32) q4w. The mean age was 14.1 years. Of the 53 participants, 48 (90.6%) completed the initial treatment phase and 36 (67.9%) received erenumab during the extension phase. Mean exposures to erenumab based on the maximum observed concentration and the area under the drug concentration-time curve during the dosing interval increased approximately dose-proportionally. A total of 42 participants (79.2%) reported TEAEs (307.2 per 100 participant-years); and four (7.5%) reported serious TEAEs not considered treatment-related. The most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and vomiting. No clinically significant changes were reported in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory and neurological assessments. Overall, the observed PK profile of erenumab in children and adolescents with migraine is consistent with that in adults when body weight differences are taken into consideration. The safety profile of erenumab in children and adolescents is consistent with that in adults.",1,1,0,0,0
40388178,Efficacy and Safety of Eptinezumab in Episodic Cluster Headache: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Cluster headache, characterized by bouts of excruciating pain attacks, detrimentally affects health and quality of life. Eptinezumab is an anticalcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody approved for migraine prevention. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in the preventive treatment of episodic cluster headache. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) clinical trial (Eptinezumab in Participants With Episodic Cluster Headache [ALLEVIATE]) was conducted between December 2020 and October 2023. Results are from the initial 4-week randomized phase. The study took place at 64 sites across Europe, the US, and Japan. Included were adults (aged 18-75 years) with a history of episodic cluster headache for 1 or more years (with bouts lasting ≥6 weeks when untreated) and previous acute and preventive medication use. Eptinezumab, 400 mg, or placebo (intravenous infusion). The primary end point was the change from baseline in the number of weekly attacks in weeks 1 to 2. Safety was assessed using treatment-emergent adverse events. Of 628 total participants screened, 320 entered the second screening period, and 231 met eligibility criteria. Of the 231 participants randomized (eptinezumab, n = 118; placebo, n = 113), 215 (93%) completed the placebo-controlled period. The participant mean (SD) age was 44 (11) years, and 178 of 229 were male (78%). At baseline, the mean (SD) weekly attacks were 15.2 (8.1) in the eptinezumab group and 15.7 (8.3) in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference between eptinezumab and placebo in the change from baseline in the number of weekly attacks over weeks 1 to 2 (least-squares mean [SE], -4.0 [0.93] vs -4.6 [0.89]; between-group difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -1.3 to 2.6; P = .50). More eptinezumab-treated participants achieved 50% or greater response vs placebo over week 2 (50.9% [54 of 106] vs 37.3% [41 of 110]; odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.07; P =.04), week 3 (62.5% [65 of 104] vs 43.8% [49 of 112]; OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.30-3.97; P =.004), and week 4 (66.7% [68 of 102] vs 50.5% [54 of 107]; OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.21-3.83; P =.009). Eptinezumab showed numerically larger improvements than placebo for 75% or greater response, average daily pain scores, and across other patient-reported outcomes. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 25.0% of patients (28 of 112) receiving eptinezumab and 26.5% of patients (31 of 117) receiving placebo. Among adults with episodic cluster headache, eptinezumab did not significantly reduce the number of attacks vs placebo, although it was associated with numerically higher responder rates and improvements in average daily pain and patient-reported outcomes. Eptinezumab was generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04688775.",1,1,0,1,0
37909676,Efficacy and Safety of Rimegepant for Migraine Patients: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Studies.,"Rimegepant may have some potential in treating migraine, and this meta-analysis aims to study the efficacy and safety of rimegepant for migraine patients. We have searched several databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library databases and selected the randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of rimegepant versus placebo for migraine patients. This meta-analysis was conducted using the random- or fixed-effect model based on the heterogeneity. Three randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo in migraine patients, rimegepant treatment was associated with substantially improved freedom from pain at 2 hours (odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-2.59; P < 0.00001), pain relief at 2 hours (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.65 to 2.25; P < 0.00001), freedom from the most bothersome symptom at 2 hours (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35-1.91; P < 0.00001), ability to function normally at 2 hours (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.42-2.01; P < 0.00001), sustained freedom from pain at 24 hours (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.74-4.78; P < 0.0001), sustained pain relief at 24 hours (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.96-2.72; P < 0.00001), and no rescue medication (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.02-2.90; P < 0.00001) but showed no obvious impact on adverse events (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60; P = 0.04).

36055877,Serious adverse events of special interest following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in randomized trials in adults.,"In 2020, prior to COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the Brighton Collaboration created a priority list, endorsed by the World Health Organization, of potential adverse events relevant to COVID-19 vaccines. We adapted the Brighton Collaboration list to evaluate serious adverse events of special interest observed in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials. Secondary analysis of serious adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled, phase III randomized clinical trials of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in adults (NCT04368728 and NCT04470427), focusing analysis on Brighton Collaboration adverse events of special interest. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 10.1 and 15.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baselines of 17.6 and 42.2 (95 % CI -0.4 to 20.6 and -3.6 to 33.8), respectively. Combined, the mRNA vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 12.5 per 10,000 vaccinated (95 % CI 2.1 to 22.9); risk ratio 1.43 (95 % CI 1.07 to 1.92). The Pfizer trial exhibited a 36 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group; risk difference 18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated (95 % CI 1.2 to 34.9); risk ratio 1.36 (95 % CI 1.02 to 1.83). The Moderna trial exhibited a 6 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group: risk difference 7.1 per 10,000 (95 % CI -23.2 to 37.4); risk ratio 1.06 (95 % CI 0.84 to 1.33). Combined, there was a 16 % higher risk of serious adverse events in mRNA vaccine recipients: risk difference 13.2 (95 % CI -3.2 to 29.6); risk ratio 1.16 (95 % CI 0.97 to 1.39). The excess risk of serious adverse events found in our study points to the need for formal harm-benefit analyses, particularly those that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. These analyses will require public release of participant level datasets.",1,0,0,0,0
34240062,Observed and expected serious adverse event rates in randomised clinical trials for hypertension: an observational study comparing trials that do and do not focus on older people.,"Representativeness of antihypertensive drug trials is uncertain, as many trials recruit few or no older people. Some trials specifically recruit older participants to address this. Here, we assess the representativeness of trials focusing on older people by comparing the rates of serious adverse events in these trials with the rates in trials of a general adult population (ie, standard trials), and comparing these findings to the rate of hospitalisations and deaths in people with hypertension starting a similar treatment in routine clinical practice. For this observational study, we identified randomised controlled trials (phase 2/3, 3, or 4) of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) drugs for hypertension registered from 1999 onwards with ClinicalTrials.gov. Serious adverse events are routinely included in trial reports and are predominantly accounted for by all-cause hospitalisations and deaths. We compared serious adverse event rates in older-people trials (minimum inclusion age ≥60 years) and standard trials (minimum inclusion age <60 years) using Poisson regression models adjusted for trial characteristics (drug type, comparison type, phase, and outcome type). We identified a community cohort of 56 036 adults with hypertension commencing similar drugs to obtain an expected rate of emergency or urgent hospitalisations or deaths, and compared this rate to observed serious adverse event rates in each trial, adjusted for age and sex. For standard trials and for older-people trials, we calculated the standardised ratio of the expected to the observed rate of serious adverse events using Poisson regression models. We included 110 trials, of which 11 (10%) were older-people trials and 99 (90%) were standard trials. Older-people trials had a higher rate of serious adverse events than did standard trials (median events per person per year 0·18 [IQR 0·12-0·29] <i>vs</i> 0·11 [0·08-0·18]; adjusted incidence rate ratio 1·76 [95% CI 1·01-3·03]). The hospitalisation and death rate in the community for those taking RAAS antihypertensives was much greater than the rate of serious adverse events reported in standard trials (standardised ratio [SR] 4·23, 95% CI 3·51-5·09) and older-people trials (4·76, 2·89-7·86), adjusting for age and sex. The magnitude of risk increase for serious adverse events in community patients taking RAAS did not differ when comparing older-people and standard trials (ratio of SRs 1·13, 95% CI 0·66-1·92). Trials report substantially fewer serious adverse events than expected from rates of hospitalisations and deaths among similar-aged people receiving equivalent treatments in the community. Serious adverse event rates might be a useful metric to assess trial representativeness. Clinicians should be cautious when applying trial recommendations to older people, even when trials focus on older participants. Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council.",1,0,0,0,0
36823047,Adverse drug reactions and associated patient characteristics in older community-dwelling adults: a 6-year prospective cohort study.,"To date, research on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has focused on secondary care, and there is a paucity of studies that have prospectively examined ADRs affecting older adults in general practice. To examine the cumulative incidence and severity of ADRs and associated patient characteristics in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Prospective cohort study of older adults (aged ≥70 years, <i>N</i> = 592) recruited from 15 general practices in the Republic of Ireland. Manual review of the participant's general practice electronic medical record, linked to the national dispensed prescription medicine database, and a detailed, self-reported patient postal questionnaire. The primary outcomes were ADR occurrence and severity over a 6-year period (2010-2016). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models examined potential associations between patient characteristics and ADR occurrence. A total of 211 ADRs were recorded for 159 participants, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 26.9% over 6 years. The majority of ADRs detected were mild (89.1%), with the remainder classified as moderate (10.9%). Eight moderate ADRs, representing 34.8% of moderate ADRs and 3.8% of all ADRs, required an emergency hospital admission. ADRs were independently associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17 to 2.85; <i>P</i> = 0.008), polypharmacy (5-9 drug classes) (adjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.82; <i>P</i> = 0.008), and major polypharmacy (≥10 drug classes) (adjusted OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.62 to 6.85; <i>P</i> = 0.001). This prospective cohort study of ADRs in general practice shows that over one-quarter of older adults experienced an ADR over a 6-year period. Polypharmacy is independently associated with ADR risk in general practice and older adults on ≥10 drug classes should be prioritised for regular medication review.",1,0,1,0,0
30458579,On estimands and the analysis of adverse events in the presence of varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapies.,"The analysis of adverse events (AEs) is a key component in the assessment of a drug's safety profile. Inappropriate analysis methods may result in misleading conclusions about a therapy's safety and consequently its benefit-risk ratio. The statistical analysis of AEs is complicated by the fact that the follow-up times can vary between the patients included in a clinical trial. This paper takes as its focus the analysis of AE data in the presence of varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapeutic interventions. Instead of approaching this issue directly and solely from an analysis point of view, we first discuss what should be estimated in the context of safety data, leading to the concept of estimands. Although the current discussion on estimands is mainly related to efficacy evaluation, the concept is applicable to safety endpoints as well. Within the framework of estimands, we present statistical methods for analysing AEs with the focus being on the time to the occurrence of the first AE of a specific type. We give recommendations which estimators should be used for the estimands described. Furthermore, we state practical implications of the analysis of AEs in clinical trials and give an overview of examples across different indications. We also provide a review of current practices of health technology assessment (HTA) agencies with respect to the evaluation of safety data. Finally, we describe problems with meta-analyses of AE data and sketch possible solutions.",1,0,0,0,0
26140524,Psychiatric and behavioral adverse events in randomized clinical studies of the noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel.,"Perampanel, a selective, noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor antagonist, is indicated for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in patients ≥12 years based on three phase III clinical studies. The perampanel U.S. Prescribing Information includes a boxed warning for serious psychiatric and behavioral adverse reactions. To provide context for this warning, detail on psychiatric and behavioral safety data from perampanel clinical studies is presented. An analysis of pooled safety data from three phase III studies in patients with partial seizures is presented. Data from phase I and phase II studies in patients with and without epilepsy were also analyzed. Psychiatric and behavioral treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms, using ""narrow"" and ""narrow-and-broad"" standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) for TEAEs suggestive of hostility/aggression. From the three phase III partial-seizure studies, the overall rate of psychiatric TEAEs was higher in the 8 mg (17.2%) and 12 mg (22.4%) perampanel groups versus placebo (12.4%). In the ""narrow"" SMQ, hostility/aggression TEAEs were observed in 2.8% for 8 mg and 6.3% for 12 mg perampanel groups, versus 0.7% of placebo patients. ""Narrow-and-broad"" SMQs for hostility/aggression TEAE rates were 12.3% for 8 mg and 20.4% for 12 mg perampanel groups, versus 5.7% for placebo; rates for events resulting in discontinuation were perampanel = 1.6% versus placebo = 0.7%. For events reported as serious AEs (SAEs), rates were perampanel = 0.7% versus placebo = 0.2%. In nonepilepsy patients, psychiatric TEAEs were similar between patients receiving perampanel and placebo. In phase I subjects/volunteers, all psychiatric TEAEs were mild or moderate. These analyses suggest that psychiatric adverse effects are associated with use of perampanel. Patients and caregivers should be counseled regarding the potential risk of psychiatric and behavioral events with perampanel in patients with partial seizures; patients should be monitored for these events during treatment, especially during titration and at higher doses.",1,0,0,1,0
16689555,Under-reporting of adverse drug reactions : a systematic review.,"The purpose of this review was to estimate the extent of under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to spontaneous reporting systems and to investigate whether there are differences between different types of ADRs. A systematic literature search was carried out to identify studies providing a numerical estimate of under-reporting. Studies were included regardless of the methodology used or the setting, e.g. hospital versus general practice. Estimates of under-reporting were either extracted directly from the published study or calculated from the study data. These were expressed as the percentage of ADRs detected from intensive data collection that were not reported to the relevant local, regional or national spontaneous reporting systems. The median under-reporting rate was calculated across all studies and within subcategories of studies using different methods or settings. In total, 37 studies using a wide variety of surveillance methods were identified from 12 countries. These generated 43 numerical estimates of under-reporting. The median under-reporting rate across the 37 studies was 94% (interquartile range 82-98%). There was no significant difference in the median under-reporting rates calculated for general practice and hospital-based studies. Five of the ten general practice studies provided evidence of a higher median under-reporting rate for all ADRs compared with more serious or severe ADRs (95% and 80%, respectively). In comparison, for five of the eight hospital-based studies the median under-reporting rate for more serious or severe ADRs remained high (95%). The median under-reporting rate was lower for 19 studies investigating specific serious/severe ADR-drug combinations but was still high at 85%. This systematic review provides evidence of significant and widespread under-reporting of ADRs to spontaneous reporting systems including serious or severe ADRs. Further work is required to assess the impact of under-reporting on public health decisions and the effects of initiatives to improve reporting such as internet reporting, pharmacist/nurse reporting and direct patient reporting as well as improved education and training of healthcare professionals.",1,0,0,0,0

We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2000, and May 21, 2020, investigating globally approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies. Only prospective trials reporting overall incidence or tabulated data of treatment-related adverse events were included. Trials investigating sequential therapies, comprising three or more classes of therapies, and enrolling less than ten patients were excluded. The primary outcomes were overall incidences and profiles for all-grade and grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events by random-effect models. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with I<sup>2</sup> statistics. The summary measures for main outcomes are incidences (95% CI). The 95% CI were calculated together with the incidence through a random-effects model with a logit transformation. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020189617). We identified 2540 records, of which 161 studies (17 197 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events in the chemotherapy combination was 97·7% (95% CI 96·4-98·5; I<sup>2</sup>=75%) for all-grade adverse events and 68·3% (60·7-75·0; I<sup>2</sup>=93%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; in the targeted therapy combination was 94·5% (90·7-96·8; I<sup>2</sup>=86%) for all-grade adverse events and 47·3% (37·3-57·5; I<sup>2</sup>=93%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; in the immunotherapy combination was 86·8% (80·9-91·1; I<sup>2</sup>=94%) for all-grade adverse events and 35·9% (29·5-42·9; I<sup>2</sup>=92%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; and in the radiotherapy combination was 89·4% (69·0-96·9; I<sup>2</sup>=74%) for all-grade adverse events and 12·4% (4·4-30·6; I<sup>2</sup>=73%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events. For these four combination therapies, the most common all-grade adverse events were anaemia (45.4% [95% CI 32·4-59·1]), fatigue (34·3% [27·5-41·9]), fatigue (26·4% [19·2-35·2]), and dysphagia (30·0% [18·7-44·5]), respectively, and the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (19·6% [13·5-27·7]), hypertension (9·3% [5·7-14·9]), lipase increased (7·2% [5·2-9·9]), and lymphopenia (10·3% [4·5-21·8]). All included randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias. Our study provides comprehensive data on treatment-related adverse events of different PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies. Our results provide an essential reference of toxicity profiles of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies for clinicians in routine practice of cancer care.

28433211,Adverse Events During a Randomized Trial of Ketamine Versus Co-Administration of Ketamine and Propofol for Procedural Sedation in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,"The co-administration of ketamine and propofol (CoKP) is thought to maximize the beneficial profile of each medication, while minimizing the respective adverse effects of each medication. Our objective was to compare adverse events between ketamine monotherapy (KM) and CoKP for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in a pediatric emergency department (ED). This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial of KM vs. CoKP in patients between 3 and 21 years of age. The attending physician administered either ketamine 1 mg/kg i.v. or ketamine 0.5 mg/kg and propofol 0.5 mg/kg i.v. The physician could administer up to three additional doses of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg/dose) or ketamine/propofol (0.25 mg/kg/dose of each). Adverse events (e.g., respiratory events, cardiovascular events, unpleasant emergence reactions) were recorded. Secondary outcomes included efficacy, recovery time, and satisfaction scores. Ninety-six patients were randomized to KM and 87 patients were randomized to CoKP. There was no difference in adverse events or type of adverse event, except nausea was more common in the KM group. Efficacy of PSA was higher in the KM group (99%) compared to the CoKP group (90%). Median recovery time was the same. Satisfaction scores by providers, including nurses, were higher for KM, although parents were equally satisfied with both sedation regimens. We found no significant differences in adverse events between the KM and CoKP groups. While CoKP is a reasonable choice for pediatric PSA, our study did not demonstrate an advantage of this combination over KM.",1,0,0,0,0
37824028,Adverse Drug Reactions to Opioids: A Study in a National Pharmacovigilance Database.,"Opioids are commonly used as analgesics; however, like any medicine, they can produce adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including nausea, constipation, dependence, and respiratory depression, that result in harmful and fatal events. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the safety of these drugs in clinical practice. This study aimed to characterize the safety profile of opioids by conducting a descriptive study based on a spontaneous reporting system (SRS) for ADRs in The Netherlands, focusing on abuse, misuse, medication errors, and differences between sexes. Reports submitted to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb from January 2003 to December 2021 with an opioid drug as the suspected/interacting medicine were analyzed. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) for drug-ADR combinations were calculated, analyzed, and corrected for sex and drug utilization (expenditure) for the Dutch population. A total of 8769 reports were analyzed. Tramadol was the opioid with the most reports during the period (n = 2746), while oxycodone or tramadol had the highest number of reports per year in the study period. The most reported ADRs from opioid use were nausea, followed by dizziness and vomiting, independent of sex, and all of them were more often reported in women. Vomiting associated with tramadol (ROR females/males = 2.17) was significantly higher in women. Buprenorphine was responsible for most ADRs when corrected for expenditure, with high RORs observed with application site hypersensitivity, application site reaction, and application site rash. Fentanyl gave rise to most of the reports of ADRs concerning abuse, misuse, and medication errors. Patients treated with opioids experienced ADRs, primarily nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. For those groups of drugs, no significant differences were found between the sexes, except for the vomiting associated with tramadol. In general, ADRs related to opioids presented higher RORs when uncorrected and corrected for sexes and expenditure than other drugs. There was more disproportionate reporting for ADRs concerning abuse, misuse, and medication errors for opioids than other drugs in the Dutch SRS.",1,0,0,0,0
38536173,Patient-Reported Adverse Events and Early Treatment Discontinuation Among Patients With Multiple Myeloma.,"There is substantial interest in capturing cancer treatment tolerability from the patient's perspective using patient-reported outcomes (PROs). To examine whether a PRO question, item 5 from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General General Physical Wellbeing Scale (GP5), was associated with early treatment discontinuation (ETD) due to adverse events. This prospective survey study was conducted from February to April 2023. Among participants in the ECOG-ACRIN E1A11 trial (a phase 3, parallel design trial conducted between 2013 and 2019), patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were randomized to receive bortezomib (VRd) or carfilzomib (KRd) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone as induction therapy. The GP5 item was administered at baseline (pretreatment) and at 1 month, 2.8 months, and 5.5 months postbaseline. Eligible participants included patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated at community oncology practices or academic medical centers in the US. GP5 response options were ""very much,"" ""quite a bit,"" ""somewhat,"" ""a little bit,"" and ""not at all."" Responses at each assessment while undergoing treatment (1 month, 2.8 months, and 5.5 months) were categorized as high adverse event bother (ie, ""very much,"" and ""quite a bit"") and low adverse event bother (ie, ""somewhat,"" ""a little bit,"" or ""not at all""). In addition, change from baseline to each assessment while undergoing treatment was calculated and categorized as worsening by 1 response category and 2 or more response categories. ETD due to adverse events (yes vs no) was analyzed using logistic regression adjusting for treatment group, performance status, gender, race, and disease stage. Of the 1087 participants in the original trial, 1058 (mean [SD] age 64 [9] years; 531 receiving VrD [50.2%]; 527 receiving KRd [49.8%]) responded to item GP5 and were included in the secondary analysis. A small proportion (142 patients [13.4%]) discontinued treatment early due to AEs. For those with high adverse-effect bother, GP5 while undergoing treatment was associated with ETD at 1 month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.20; 95% CI, 1.25-3.89), 2.8 months (aOR, 3.41; 95% CI, 2.01-5.80), and 5.5 months (aOR, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.69-12.83). Worsening by 2 or more response categories on the GP5 was associated with ETD at 2.8 months (aOR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.64-5.54) and 5.5 months (aOR, 5.49; 95% CI, 1.45-20.76). In this survey study of the E1A11 trial, worse GP5 response was associated with ETD. These findings suggest that simple assessment of adverse-effect bother while receiving treatment is an efficient way to indicate treatment tolerability and ETD risk.",1,0,0,0,0
38854273,"Causality, Severity, Preventability and Predictability Assessments Scales for Adverse Drug Reactions: A Review.","The pharmacovigilance program of India (PvPI), after its inception, has been reliably acquiring force in bringing issues to light among the masses, healthcare professionals, the pharma industry, and clinical staff at hospitals. Adverse drug reactions are unintended events that occur after exposure to a drug, biological product, or medical device, and they may result in morbidity and mortality. It is critical to monitor the safety of drugs during the post-marketing phase to find long-term and rare ADRs, as well as ADRs in special populations and patients with co-morbidities that are not usually included during clinical trials. The definitive objective of pharmacovigilance is to collate data and analyze it. Assessing the causality between ADRs and drugs is necessary to decrease the occurrence of ADRs and to reduce the risk of drug-related ADRs. ADRs may lead to increased morbidity, increased hospital stays, and increased cost of treatment, resulting in compromised patient safety. Causality assessment is the evaluation of the likelihood that a particular treatment is the cause of an observed adverse event and establishing a causal association between a drug and a drug reaction is necessary to prevent further recurrences. Numerous methods available for establishing a causal association between the drug and adverse events have been broadly classified into clinical judgment or global introspection, algorithms, and probabilistic methods. These include the Swedish method, World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) scale, Naranjo's algorithm, Kramer algorithm, Jones algorithm, Karch algorithm, Bégaud algorithm, Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee guidelines, Bayesian Adverse Reaction Diagnostic Instrument, and so on. Despite various methods available, none of the causality assessment tools have been universally accepted as the gold standard. Naranjo's algorithm and WHO-UMC scales are, however, the most commonly used. Similarly, for preventability and severity assessment of ADRs, the Schumock and Thornton scale and Hartwig and Siegel's scale are most commonly used. Hence, we reviewed different tools and methods available to assess the causality, preventability, and severity of ADRs.",1,0,0,0,0
37948080,Adverse Event Reporting in Randomized Clinical Trials for Multiple Myeloma.,"Cancer treatment can result in burdensome toxic effects that profoundly affect patient quality of life. In seeking to emphasize the efficacy of tested treatments, clinical trial reports may use subjective or minimizing terms to describe adverse events (AEs). To evaluate patterns of AE reporting in multiple myeloma (MM) randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published between 2015 and early 2023. For this cohort study, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to assess the prevalence of minimizing terms in MM RCTs published between January 1, 2015, and March 1, 2023. Minimizing terms were defined as subjective terms used to favorably describe the safety profile of the intervention. The terms searched included convenient, manageable, acceptable, expected, well-tolerated, tolerable, favorable, and safe. Final data analysis was performed on July 21, 2023. The primary outcome was the occurrence of at least 1 minimizing term in an article. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the presence of at least 1 minimizing term and the actual incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs, serious AEs, or grade 5 AEs. Of the 65 RCTs included, 56 (86%) used minimizing terms when describing treatment-emergent AEs. The most frequently used minimizing terms were well-tolerated or tolerable in 29 trials (45%), manageable in 18 (28%), and acceptable in 16 (25%). Grade 3 or 4 AE rate in the examined RCTs ranged from 23% to 94%, with a median of 75% (IQR, 59%-82%). A univariate regression analysis demonstrated no association between the use of minimizing terms and grade 3 or 4 AE rates (odds ratio [OR], 1.35 [95% CI, 0.88-2.10] per 10% AE rate increase; P = .17) or grade 5 AE rates (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 0.27-12.7] per 10% AE rate increase; P = .45). These findings suggest that trial investigators and sponsors regularly use minimizing terms to describe toxic effects in MM trials, and use of this terminology may not reflect actual AE rates in these studies. Instead of using these terms, trial investigators should highlight event rates and patient-reported outcomes, to allow clinicians and patients to better evaluate the true tolerability of AEs.",1,0,0,0,0
35788071,"Adverse drug reactions, multimorbidity and polypharmacy: a prospective analysis of 1 month of medical admissions.","To ascertain the burden and associated cost of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), polypharmacy and multimorbidity through a prospective analysis of all medical admissions to a large university teaching hospital over a 1-month period. Prospective observational study. Liverpool University Hospital Foundation National Health Service (NHS) Trust, England. All medical admissions with greater than 24-hour stay over a 1-month period. Prevalence of admissions due to an ADR and associated mortality, prevalence and association of multimorbidity and polypharmacy with ADRs, and estimated local financial cost of admissions where an ADR was a contributing or main reason for admission with projected costs for NHS in England. There were 218 identified patient admissions with an ADR giving a prevalence of 18.4%. The majority of these (90.4%) were ADRs that directly resulted in or contributed to admission. ADRs thus accounted for 16.5% of total admissions. Those with an ADR were on average taking more medicines (10.5 vs 7.8, p<0.01) and had more comorbidities than those without an ADR (6.1 vs 5.2, p<0.01). Drugs most commonly implicated were diuretics, steroid inhalers, anticoagulants and antiplatelets, proton pump inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents and antihypertensives. 40.4% of ADRs were classified avoidable or possibly avoidable. The mortality rate due to an ADR was 0.34%. The average length of stay for those with an ADR was 6 days. Direct 1-month cost to the Trust from ADR admissions was £490 716. Extrapolated nationally, the projected annual cost to the NHS in England is 2.21 billion. The local prevalence of admission and mortality from ADRs is higher than previously reported. Important factors that could be contributing to this include polypharmacy and multimorbidity. ADRs place a significant burden on patients and healthcare services with associated financial implications. Reducing inappropriate polypharmacy should be a major aim for preventing ADRs.",1,0,0,0,0
38589749,Adverse Event Reporting in Cancer Clinical Trials: Incorporating Patient-Reported Methods. A Systematic Scoping Review.,"The history of clinical trials is fraught with unethical practices. Since 1945, robust frameworks have evolved to standardise the collection and reporting of safety data, most notably, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) from the National Cancer Institute; used by investigators to report side effects experienced by participants. As medicine moves into the patient-centred model, interest has been growing to collect data on adverse events directly from participants (patient-reported adverse events). The aim of this systematic scoping review was to investigate the inclusion of patient-reported adverse event data within safety/tolerability analyses and explore the collection and reporting of patient-reported adverse event data. A database search was undertaken and the Covidence platform was used to manage the review; results were analysed descriptively. Sixty-eight studies were included in the analysis. An increase in the number of studies that incorporate patient-reported adverse event data was seen by year. Seventy instruments were used for the collection of patient-reported adverse event data with recall period, mode, frequency and site of administration varying across studies; the duration of data collection ranged from 28 days to 6 years. Frequently, information on these details was omitted from publications. The number of instruments used by studies to collect patient-reported adverse event data ranged from one to seven instruments. Despite growing calls for the inclusion of patient-reported adverse events, this has not yet translated into published reports. The collection and reporting of these data were variable and conducted using instruments that were not designed for purpose. To address these inconsistencies, standardisation of data collection and reporting using a purpose-built validated instrument is required.",1,0,0,0,0
24677235,Testing cardiovascular drug safety and efficacy in randomized trials.,"Randomized trials provide the gold standard evidence on which rests the decision to approve novel therapeutics for clinical use. They are large and expensive and provide average but unbiased estimates of efficacy and risk. Concern has been expressed about how unrepresentative populations and conditions that pertain in randomized trials might be of the real world, including concerns about the homogeneity of the biomedical and adherence characteristics of volunteers entered into such trials, the dose and constancy of drug administration and the mixture of additional medications that are restricted in such trials but might influence outcome in practice. A distinction has been drawn between trials that establish efficacy and those that demonstrate effectiveness, drugs that patients actually consume in the real world for clinical benefit. However, randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for establishing efficacy and the testing of effectiveness with less rigorous approaches is a secondary, albeit important consideration. Despite this, there is an appreciation that average results may conceal considerable interindividual variation in drug response, leading to a failure to appreciate clinical value or risk in subsets of patients. Thus, attempts are now being made to individualize risk estimates by modulating those derived from large randomized trials with the individual baseline risk estimates based on demographic and biological criteria-the individual Numbers Needed to Treat to obtain a benefit, such as a life saved. Here, I will consider some reasons why large phase 3 trials-by far the most expensive element of drug development-may fail to address the unmet medical needs, which should justify such effort and investment.",1,1,0,1,0
38933603,Characterization of adverse events in injured patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock: a secondary analysis of three harmonized prehospital randomized clinical trials.,"The reporting of adverse events (AEs) is required and well defined in the execution of clinical trials, but is poorly characterized particularly in prehospital trials focusing on traumatic injury. In the setting of prehospital traumatic injury trials, no literature currently exists analyzing the clinical implications of AEs and their associations with mortality and morbidity. We sought to analyze AEs from three prehospital hemorrhagic shock trials and characterize their time course, incidence, severity, associated clinical outcomes, and relatedness. We performed a secondary analysis of three prehospital randomized clinical trials. We analyzed AEs at both the patient level as well as the individual AE level. We categorized patients who had no AEs, a single documented AE and those with multiple events (>1 AE). We characterized AE timing, severity, relatedness and attributable mortality outcomes. We included 1490 patients from the three harmonized clinical trials, with 299 (20.1%) individual patients having at least a single AE documented with 529 AEs documented overall as a proportion of patients had multiple events. Over 44% of patients had a death-related misclassified AE. Patients with at least a single documented AE had a significantly higher 28-day mortality (log-rank χ<sup>2</sup>=81.27, p<0.001) compared with those without an AE documented. Patients with a single AE had a significant higher mortality than those with multiple AEs, potentially due to survival bias (log-rank χ<sup>2</sup>=11.80, p=0.006). When relatedness of each individual AE was characterized, over 97% of AEs were classified as 'definitely not related' or 'probably not related' to the intervention. AEs in hemorrhagic shock trials are common, occur early and are associated with mortality and survival bias. The potential for inaccurate reporting exists, and education and training remain essential for appropriate treatment arm comparison. The current results have important relevance to injury-related clinical trials. NCT01818427, NCT02086500 and NCT03477006. II.",1,0,0,0,0
33646267,Effect of a Multifaceted Clinical Pharmacist Intervention on Medication Safety After Hospitalization in Persons Prescribed High-risk Medications: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"The National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event (ADE) Prevention identified 3 high-priority, high-risk drug classes as targets for reducing the risk of drug-related injuries: anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioids. To determine whether a multifaceted clinical pharmacist intervention improves medication safety for patients who are discharged from the hospital and prescribed medications within 1 or more of these high-risk drug classes. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at a large multidisciplinary group practice in Massachusetts and included patients 50 years or older who were discharged from the hospital and prescribed at least 1 high-risk medication. Participants were enrolled into the trial from June 2016 through September 2018. The pharmacist-directed intervention included an in-home assessment by a clinical pharmacist, evidence-based educational resources, communication with the primary care team, and telephone follow-up. Participants in the control group were provided educational materials via mail. The study assessed 2 outcomes over a 45-day posthospital discharge period: (1) adverse drug-related incidents and (2) a subset defined as clinically important medication errors, which included preventable or ameliorable ADEs and potential ADEs (ie, medication-related errors that may not yet have caused injury to a patient, but have the potential to cause future harm if not addressed). Clinically important medication errors were the primary study outcome. There were 361 participants (mean [SD] age, 68.7 [9.3] years; 177 women [49.0%]; 319 White [88.4%] and 8 Black individuals [2.2%]). Of these, 180 (49.9%) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 181 (50.1%) to the control group. Among all participants, 100 (27.7%) experienced 1 or more adverse drug-related incidents, and 65 (18%) experienced 1 or more clinically important medication errors. There were 81 adverse drug-related incidents identified in the intervention group and 72 in the control group. There were 44 clinically important medication errors in the intervention group and 45 in the control group. The intervention did not significantly alter the per-patient rate of adverse drug-related incidents (unadjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.83-1.56) or clinically important medication errors (unadjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.65-1.49). In this randomized clinical trial, there was not an observed lower rate of adverse drug-related incidents or clinically important medication errors during the posthospitalization period that was associated with a clinical pharmacist intervention. However, there were study recruitment challenges and lower than expected numbers of events among the study population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02781662.",1,0,0,0,0
37689822,The INGENIOUS trial: Impact of pharmacogenetic testing on adverse events in a pragmatic clinical trial.,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) account for a significant mortality, morbidity, and cost burden. Pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to reduce ADEs and inefficacy. The objective of this INGENIOUS trial (NCT02297126) analysis was to determine whether conducting and reporting pharmacogenetic panel testing impacts ADE frequency. The trial was a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial, adapted as a propensity matched analysis in individuals (N = 2612) receiving a new prescription for one or more of 26 pharmacogenetic-actionable drugs across a community safety-net and academic health system. The intervention was a pharmacogenetic testing panel for 26 drugs with dosage and selection recommendations returned to the health record. The primary outcome was occurrence of ADEs within 1 year, according to modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). In the propensity-matched analysis, 16.1% of individuals experienced any ADE within 1-year. Serious ADEs (CTCAE level ≥ 3) occurred in 3.2% of individuals. When combining all 26 drugs, no significant difference was observed between the pharmacogenetic testing and control arms for any ADE (Odds ratio 0.96, 95% CI: 0.78-1.18), serious ADEs (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.58-1.40), or mortality (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.28-1.21). However, sub-group analyses revealed a reduction in serious ADEs and death in individuals who underwent pharmacogenotyping for aripiprazole and serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (OR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12-0.85). In conclusion, no change in overall ADEs was observed after pharmacogenetic testing. However, limitations incurred during INGENIOUS likely affected the results. Future studies may consider preemptive, rather than reactive, pharmacogenetic panel testing.",1,1,0,0,0
37923529,Guidelines for Data and Safety Monitoring in Pragmatic Randomized Clinical Trials Using Case Studies.,"Pragmatic randomized clinical trials (pRCTs) have a unique set of considerations for data and safety monitoring. Because of their unconventional trial designs coupled with collection of multilevel data and implementation outcomes in real-world settings, thoughtful consideration is needed on the presentation of the trial design and accruing data to facilitate review and decision-making by the trial's data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). To our knowledge, there is limited information available in practical guidelines for generalists and medical general practitioners on what to monitor and to report to the DSMB during the conduct of pRCTs and what the DSMB should focus on in its review of reports. This article discusses these matters in the context of 3 case studies focusing on a set of critical data and safety monitoring questions that would be of interest to the generalist conducting pRCTs. In considering these questions, we provide tabular and graphical illustrations of how data can be presented to the DSMB while drawing attention to those areas that the DSMB should focus on in its review of the trial. The strategies and viewpoints discussed herein provide practical guidelines and can serve as a resource for the generalist conducting pRCTs.",1,1,0,0,0
34469805,Can preclinical drug development help to predict adverse events in clinical trials?,"The development of novel therapeutics is associated with high rates of attrition, with unexpected adverse events being a major cause of failure. Serious adverse events have led to organ failure, cancer development and deaths that were not expected outcomes in clinical trials. These life-threatening events were not identified during therapeutic development due to the lack of preclinical safety tests that faithfully represented human physiology. We highlight the successful application of several novel technologies, including high-throughput screening, organs-on-chips, microbiome-containing drug-testing platforms and humanised mouse models, for mechanistic studies and prediction of toxicity. We propose the incorporation of similar preclinical tests into future drug development to reduce the likelihood of hazardous therapeutics entering later-stage clinical trials.",1,0,0,0,0
38691387,Efficacy and Safety of Xanomeline-Trospium Chloride in Schizophrenia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"A significant need exists for new antipsychotic medications with different mechanisms of action, greater efficacy, and better tolerability than existing agents. Xanomeline is a dual M1/M4 preferring muscarinic receptor agonist with no direct D2 dopamine receptor blocking activity. KarXT combines xanomeline with the peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist trospium chloride with the goal of reducing adverse events due to xanomeline-related peripheral muscarinic receptor activation. In prior trials, xanomeline-trospium chloride was effective in reducing symptoms of psychosis and generally well tolerated in people with schizophrenia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of xanomeline-trospium vs placebo in adults with schizophrenia. EMERGENT-3 (NCT04738123) was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-week trial of xanomeline-trospium in people with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis, conducted between April 1, 2021, and December 7, 2022, at 30 inpatient sites in the US and Ukraine. Data were analyzed from February to June 2023. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive xanomeline-trospium chloride (maximum dose xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg) or placebo for 5 weeks. The prespecified primary end point was change from baseline to week 5 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. Secondary outcome measures were change from baseline to week 5 in PANSS positive subscale score, PANSS negative subscale score, PANSS Marder negative factor score, Clinical Global Impression-Severity score, and proportion of participants with at least a 30% reduction in PANSS total score. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. A total of 256 participants (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [11.8] years; 191 men [74.6%]; 156 of 256 participants [60.9%] were Black or African American, 98 [38.3%] were White, and 1 [0.4%] was Asian) were randomized (125 in xanomeline-trospium group and 131 in placebo group). At week 5, xanomeline-trospium significantly reduced PANSS total score compared with placebo (xanomeline-trospium , -20.6; placebo, -12.2; least squares mean difference, -8.4; 95% CI, -12.4 to -4.3; P < .001; Cohen d effect size, 0.60). Discontinuation rates due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the xanomeline-trospium (8 participants [6.4%]) and placebo (7 participants [5.5%]) groups. The most common TEAEs in the xanomeline-trospium vs placebo group were nausea (24 participants [19.2%] vs 2 participants [1.6%]), dyspepsia (20 participants [16.0%] vs 2 participants [1.6%]), vomiting (20 participants [16.0%] vs 1 participant [0.8%]), and constipation (16 participants [12.8%] vs 5 participants [3.9%]). Measures of extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and somnolence were similar between treatment groups. Xanomeline-trospium was efficacious and well tolerated in people with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis. These findings, together with the previously reported and consistent results from the EMERGENT-1 and EMERGENT-2 trials, support the potential of xanomeline-trospium to be the first in a putative new class of antipsychotic medications without D2 dopamine receptor blocking activity.

9591924,Adverse events in phase-I studies: a report in 1015 healthy volunteers.,"This report describes all clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographical adverse events detected in healthy volunteers in a phase-I centre over a 10-year period: 54 phase-I studies are involved, including 1015 healthy young volunteers (993 males) who received 1538 treatments (23 different active drugs or placebo) corresponding to 12143 days of follow-up. This updates a similar report published previously in the European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Adverse events were defined as all events noted in case-report forms. Incidence of adverse events was defined as the ratio between the number of adverse events and the number of follow-up days. Severity was rated as death, life-threatening, severe or minor. Incidences or occurrence rates were compared using the Chi-squared test with Yates' correction. The overall incidence of adverse events was 12.8% with a significant difference between active-drug (13.7%) and placebo (7.9%) treatments. There were 1558 adverse events of 110 distinct kinds. Only for three (headache, diarrhoea and dyspepsia) was the incidence superior to 10 per thousand. Most of these adverse events were also observed with placebo. Ninety-seven percentage of adverse events were of minor intensity; forty three (3%) were rated as severe, including nine worrying cases - six malaises with loss of consciousness, one atrial fibrillation, one hyperthyroidism and one bicytopenia. Some of the adverse events were not related to the tested drugs, but to a vagal reaction or to study conditions. There was no death or life-threatening event. The global rate of occurrence was one adverse event per treatment, one and a half per subject and one out of eight follow-up days. No difference in the overall incidence with placebo was observed between the two successive 5-year periods. This report confirms that adverse events in phase I studies are very common, usually of minor intensity and rarely severe; even though exceptional, life-threatening adverse events are possible. Adverse events occurring in phase I are rarely published, leading to lack of information. Thus, authors invite clinical research organization (CROs) and phase-I centres to regularly publicise at least severe adverse events; they also suggest that the life-threatening adverse events reported to health authorities should be publicised, for example by the World Health Organization (WHO).",1,0,0,0,0
11888350,Improving safety reporting from randomised trials.,"Randomised clinical trials offer a unique opportunity for capturing safety information under a controlled setting that minimises biases in the comparison of different therapeutic options. Nevertheless, empirical evidence across diverse medical fields suggests that the reporting of safety information in clinical trials is largely neglected and receives less attention compared with efficacy outcomes. An analysis of 192 randomised trials has shown that reasons for withdrawals due to toxicity were specified per study arm in only 46% of the trial reports. Adequate reporting of clinical adverse effects and laboratory-determined toxicity occurred in only 39 and 29% of the trials, respectively, even with lenient definitions of what constitutes adequate reporting. The use of standardised scales for adverse effects is a prerequisite for improved reporting on safety in randomised trials. Safety data need to be collected and analysed in a systematic fashion and active surveillance for toxicity during the conduct of a randomised trial is preferable to passive surveillance. Standardised reporting of safety data does not necessarily require extensive space to accomplish. It is essential to provide numerical data per study arm on each type of adverse effect along with a categorisation of the severity of the adverse effects with an emphasis on severe and life-threatening reactions. The severity grading must be referred to well-known standardised scales and new scales need to be carefully defined. Information on withdrawals due to toxicity is also important to report, along with the specific reasons leading to discontinuation. Tabulation of information may be helpful and rare or not previously reported adverse effects should be described in detail. The availability of newer options such as electronic publication, publication of raw databases, large database research, meta-analytic approaches, and prospective registration of clinical trials and of their databases may further improve the safety insights we can gain from randomised clinical trials.",1,0,0,0,0
21442687,Assessing general side effects in clinical trials: reference data from the general population.,"Side effects in clinical trials are frequently assessed in an unstructured fashion, using ascertainment strategies with unclear quality criteria. To improve the assessment and interpretation of general side effects, a structured approach is presented and validated (General Assessment of Side Effects, GASE). Base rates and reference data of the general population as well as quality criteria of this new side effect ascertainment method are provided. We developed a screener assessing the most common subjective side effects of clinical trials (according to FDA statistics and others). The screener was evaluated in a general population survey including 2512 participants, 1276 of them taking drugs. We present reference data of the general population that help to interpret and compare future results of clinical trials assessing general side effects. Highest scores for side effects were reported from users of psychopharmacological drugs, medium scores of people taking antihypertensives, and lower scores of people taking lipid-lowering drugs, pain killers, and antidiabetics. If people take multiple drugs, more side effects are reported compared to single-class drugs. This confirms GASE's validity to assess side effects. We suggest that a structured, patient-based approach to assess general side effects could improve the detection of drug-induced side effects. The problem of clinical studies being underpowered to detect side effects could be reduced by using more reliable approaches. Our plea is for side effect ascertainment with sophisticated approaches for expected side effects, systematic screening for general side effects, and open question methods for spontaneous reports.",1,0,0,0,0
34570002,Challenges and Barriers to Adverse Event Reporting in Clinical Trials: A Children's Oncology Group Report.,"Adverse event (AE) reporting is crucial for determining safety of trials. Adverse events are captured manually by clinical research associates (CRAs) and research nurses (RNs), and prior studies show underreporting. It is necessary to understand AE reporting training, processes, and institution-level differences to improve AE capture. A 26-item questionnaire regarding AE reporting training, identification, tracking, and challenges was distributed to all Children's Oncology Group (COG) CRAs and RNs from February 15 to March 11, 2019, regardless of if they report AEs based on limitations of COG rosters. Results were tabulated. Institutions were grouped by self-reported full-time equivalents and compared using χ2 tests. Of 1315 CRAs and 2703 RNs surveyed, 509 (12.7%) responded. Of those, 369 (64.9%) representing 71.8% of COG institutions report AEs. Only data from respondents who report AEs were collected and analyzed. There was a range in AE training; COG training modules were most common (79.7%). There was wide variability in AE ascertainment; only 51.2% use standardized approaches at their site. There was no standard AE tracking method; larger sites more commonly use spreadsheets (P = 0.002) and smaller sites more commonly use paper (P = 0.028). The greatest AE reporting challenges were differences between protocols (70%) and between AE definitions and documentation (53%). Half of the respondents endorsed 6 of 13 proposed tools for improving reporting including online AE reporting modules (75.3%), tip sheets for interpreting Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events definitions (67.5%), and standardized AE tracking forms (66.9%). Only half of the respondents reported that all colleagues at their site followed the same AE reporting practices, and there was no dominant AE tracking approach across the respondents. There is wide variability in AE reporting training and practices. Numerous challenges exist, including differences between trials, challenges in interpreting AE definitions, and engaging clinicians. Respondents are eager for additional central resources. These results provide a roadmap for areas of potential improvement.",1,0,0,0,0
36897180,Safety of Fezolinetant for Vasomotor Symptoms Associated With Menopause: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of fezolinetant on endometrial health over 52 weeks. We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 52-week safety study (SKYLIGHT 4 [Study to Find Out How Safe Long-term Treatment With Fezolinetant is in Women With Hot Flashes Going Through Menopause]) of placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg, and fezolinetant 45 mg once daily (1:1:1). Participants were postmenopausal and seeking treatment for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. Primary endpoints were treatment-emergent adverse events, percentage of participants with endometrial hyperplasia, and percentage with endometrial malignancy. Endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was evaluated according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance (point estimate of 1% or less with an upper bound of one-sided 95% CI of 4% or less). Secondary endpoints included change in bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score. A sample size of 1,740 was calculated to enable observation of one or more events (≈80% probability for events with background rate of less than 1%). A total of 1,830 participants were randomized and took one or more medication dose (July 2019-January 2022). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 64.1% (391/610) of the placebo group, 67.9% (415/611) of the fezolinetant 30-mg group, and 63.9% (389/609) of the fezolinetant 45-mg group. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were similar across groups (placebo, 26/610 [4.3%]; fezolinetant 30 mg, 34/611 [5.6%]; fezolinetant 45 mg, 28/609 [4.6%]). Endometrial safety was assessed in 599 participants. In the fezolinetant 45-mg group, 1 of 203 participants had endometrial hyperplasia (0.5%; upper limit of one-sided 95% CI 2.3%); there were no cases in the placebo (0/186) or fezolinetant 30 mg (0/210) group. Endometrial malignancy occurred in 1 of 210 in the fezolinetant 30-mg group (0.5%; 95% CI 2.2%) with no cases in the other groups. Liver enzyme elevations more than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 6 of 583 placebo, 8 of 590 fezolinetant 30 mg, and 12 of 589 fezolinetant 45 mg participants; no Hy's law cases were reported (ie, no severe drug-induced liver injury with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin more than two times the upper limit of normal, with no elevation of alkaline phosphatase and no other reason to explain the combination). Changes in BMD and trabecular bone score were similar across groups. Results from SKYLIGHT 4 confirm the 52-week safety and tolerability of fezolinetant and support its continued development.

9555760,Incidence of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"To estimate the incidence of serious and fatal adverse drug reactions (ADR) in hospital patients. Four electronic databases were searched from 1966 to 1996. Of 153, we selected 39 prospective studies from US hospitals. Data extracted independently by 2 investigators were analyzed by a random-effects model. To obtain the overall incidence of ADRs in hospitalized patients, we combined the incidence of ADRs occurring while in the hospital plus the incidence of ADRs causing admission to hospital. We excluded errors in drug administration, noncompliance, overdose, drug abuse, therapeutic failures, and possible ADRs. Serious ADRs were defined as those that required hospitalization, were permanently disabling, or resulted in death. The overall incidence of serious ADRs was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2%-8.2%) and of fatal ADRs was 0.32% (95% CI, 0.23%-0.41%) of hospitalized patients. We estimated that in 1994 overall 2216000 (1721000-2711000) hospitalized patients had serious ADRs and 106000 (76000-137000) had fatal ADRs, making these reactions between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death. The incidence of serious and fatal ADRs in US hospitals was found to be extremely high. While our results must be viewed with circumspection because of heterogeneity among studies and small biases in the samples, these data nevertheless suggest that ADRs represent an important clinical issue.",1,0,0,0,0
29695966,Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients: Results of the FORWARD (Facilitation of Reporting in Hospital Ward) Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important public health problem, representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, several countries have no recent studies available. Since 2014, a prospective active pharmacovigilance project, aimed to improve ADRs monitoring in hospital wards (FORWARD) was performed in Sicily. This study, as part of FORWARD project, was aimed to describe ADRs occurred during the hospital stay in Internal Medicine wards. ADRs related to hospital admission, characteristics and preventability of ADRs were also evaluated. <b>Methods:</b> Demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data on patients admitted to six wards of Internal Medicine, from 2014 to 2015, were collected by trained, qualified monitors, who screened all medical records. The rate of ADRs occurred during hospital stay and those leading to hospitalization were analyzed. A descriptive analysis of the reactions, suspected drugs, and associated factors was performed according to the setting analyzed. <b>Results:</b> During the study period, 4,802 admissions were recorded; in 3.2% of them ADRs occurred during hospital stay while in 6.2%, admission was due to ADRs. The duration of hospital stay was longer in patients who experienced ADRs during hospitalization, compared to patients without ADRs [median days 12 (Q1-Q3: 8-17) vs. 9 (6-13)]; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Females [OR1.39 (95% CI 1.03-1.93)] and patients taking ≥ 4 drugs [OR1.46 (95% CI 1.06-2.03)] were more likely to experience ADRs during hospital stay, as well as to be admitted because of ADRs [female: OR1.75 (95% CI 1.37-2.24); ≥ 4 drugs: OR2.14 (95% CI 1.67-2.74)]. The most frequent ADRs occurred during hospital stay were <i>cutaneous</i> (26.8%), <i>general</i> (13.4%), <i>vascular</i> (13.4%), and <i>cardiac</i> (11.5%) disorders and the drug classes mainly involved were anti-bacterials (38.2%) and antithrombotic agents (21.7%). ADRs were serious in 44.6% and probably preventable in 69.4%. <i>Gastrointestinal</i> (27.7%), <i>hematological</i> (26.5%), <i>metabolic</i> (18.1%), and <i>nervous</i> (16.1%) disorders were the main ADRs cause of hospitalization, primarily due to antithrombotic agents (39.0%) RAS-inhibitors (13.9%), NSAIDs (11.9%), and diuretics (9.0%). Only 12.9% of them was not preventable. <b>Conclusion:</b> Adverse drug reactions occurred during hospitalization or contributing to admission to Internal Medicine wards were considerable and most of them were preventable. Females and patients taking many medications were more likely to present ADRs both during hospital stay or as cause of admission.",1,0,1,0,0

Publications were reviewed according to a 24-point score based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidance. <b>Results:</b> We identified 81 trials (>45,000 patients). The experimental drug was studied as single agent in 51% of the cases; setting of disease was mainly (95%) advanced/metastatic. Lowest scores in adverse event (AE) description regarded: reporting recurrent/late toxicities and duration of the AEs (>90%), time of occurrence and indication of all-grade AEs (>75%). <b>Conclusion:</b> Suboptimal reporting of AEs in trials leading to approval of TTs and immunotherapy was shown.

36008705,Evaluation of the patient experience of symptomatic adverse events on Phase I clinical trials using PRO-CTCAE.,"Adverse event (AE) reporting in early-phase clinical trials is essential in determining the tolerability of experimental anticancer therapies. The patient-reported outcome version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE) evaluates AE components such as severity and interference in daily life. The aim of this study was to correlate the grade of clinician-reported AEs with patients' reported experience of these toxicities using PRO-CTCAE. Patients with advanced solid tumours enrolled on Phase I clinical trials were surveyed using the PRO-CTCAE. Symptomatic AEs were recorded by physicians using the CTCAE. A logistic regression model was used to assess associations between CTCAE grade and PRO responses. Of 219 evaluable patients, 81 experienced a high-grade (3/4) clinician-reported symptom, and of these, only 32 (40%) and 26 (32%) patients concordantly reported these as either severe or very severe, and interfering with daily life either 'quite a bit' or 'very much', respectively. Of the 137 patients who experienced a low-grade (1/2) clinician-reported AE as their worst symptom, 98 (72%) and 118 (86%) patients concordantly reported these as either mild-moderate severity and minimally interfering with daily life, respectively. There was a statistically significant association between clinician-reported AE grade and interference. Interference scores were also associated with dose reductions. This is the first study to explore patient-reported severity and interference from symptomatic toxicities and compare clinician grading of the same toxicities. The study provided further evidence to support the added value of the PRO-CTCAE in Phase I oncology trials, which would make AE reporting patient-centred. Further work is needed to determine how this would affect the assessment of tolerability.",1,0,0,0,0
31186300,PIONEER 1: Randomized Clinical Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Semaglutide Monotherapy in Comparison With Placebo in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"This trial compared the efficacy and safety of the first oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, oral semaglutide, as monotherapy with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes managed by diet and exercise alone. Two estimands addressed two efficacy-related questions: a treatment policy estimand (regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication use) and a trial product estimand (on trial product without rescue medication use) in all randomized patients. This was a 26-week, phase 3a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in 93 sites in nine countries. Adults with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled with diet and exercise were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily oral semaglutide 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg, or placebo. The primary end point was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The confirmatory secondary end point was change from baseline to week 26 in body weight. In the 703 patients randomized (mean age 55 years, 50.8% male, and mean baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]), oral semaglutide reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> (placebo-adjusted treatment differences at week 26: treatment policy estimand, -0.6% [3 mg], -0.9% [7 mg], and -1.1% [14 mg]; trial product estimand, -0.7% [3 mg], -1.2% [7 mg], and -1.4% [14 mg]; <i>P</i> < 0.001 for all) and body weight (treatment policy, -0.1 kg [3 mg], -0.9 kg [7 mg], and -2.3 kg [14 mg, <i>P</i> < 0.001]; trial product, -0.2 kg [3 mg], -1.0 kg [7 mg, <i>P</i> = 0.01], and -2.6 kg [14 mg, <i>P</i> < 0.001]). Mild-to-moderate transient gastrointestinal events were the most common adverse events with oral semaglutide. Trial product discontinuations occurred in 2.3-7.4% with oral semaglutide and 2.2% with placebo. In patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide monotherapy demonstrated superior and clinically relevant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (all doses) and body weight loss (14 mg dose) versus placebo, with a safety profile consistent with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.",1,1,0,1,0
37984336,Drug-drug interactions and the risk of adverse drug reaction-related hospital admissions in the older population.,"The aims of this study were to estimate potentially clinically important drug-drug interaction (DDI) prevalence, and the average causal effect of DDI exposure on adverse drug reaction (ADR)-related hospital admission, and to examine differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and length of stay (LOS) per DDI exposure in an older (≥65 years) population acutely hospitalized. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 798 older individuals acutely admitted to hospital in Ireland between 2016 and 2017. Medication (current/recently discontinued/over-the-counter) and clinical data (e.g., creatinine clearance) were available. DDIs were identified using the British National Formulary (BNF) and Stockley's Drug Interactions. Causal inference models for DDI exposure on ADR-related hospital admission were developed using directed acyclic graphs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the average causal effect. Differences in HRQoL (EQ-5D) and LOS per DDI exposure were examined non-parametrically. DDI prevalence, adjusted odds ratios (aOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. A total of 782 (98.0%) individuals using two or more drugs were included. Mean age was 80.9 (SD ± 7.5) years (range: 66-105); 52.2% were female; and 45.1% (n = 353) had an ADR-related admission. At admission, 316 (40.4% [95% CI: 37.0-43.9]) patients had at least one DDI. The average causal effect of DDI exposure on ADR-related hospital admission was aOR = 1.21 [95% CI: 0.89-1.64]. This was significantly increased by exposure to: DDIs which increase bleeding risk (aOR = 2.00 [1.26-3.12]); aspirin-warfarin (aOR = 2.78 [1.37-5.65]); and esomeprazole-escitalopram (aOR = 3.22 [1.13-10.25]. DDI-exposed patients had lower HRQoL (mean EQ-5D = 0.49 [±0.39]) compared those non-DDI-exposed (mean EQ-5D = 0.57 [±0.41]), (P = .03); and greater median LOS in hospital (8 [IQR5-16]days) compared those non-DDI-exposed (7 [IQR 4-14] days),(P = .04). Potentially clinically important DDIs carry an increased average causal effect on ADR-related admission, significantly (two-fold) by exposure to DDIs that increase bleeding risk, which should be targeted for medicine optimization.",1,0,1,0,0
32998522,"Adverse event load, onset, and maximum grade: A novel method of reporting adverse events in cancer clinical trials.","Current adverse event reporting practices do not document longitudinal characteristics of adverse effects, and alternative methods are not easily interpretable and have not been employed by clinical trials. Introducing time parameters in the evaluation of safety that are comprehensive yet easily interpretable could allow for a better understanding of treatment quality. In this study, we developed and applied a novel adverse event reporting method based on longitudinal adverse event changes to aid describing, summarizing, and presenting adverse event profile. We termed it the ""Adverse Event Load, Onset, and Maximum Grade"" method. We developed two adverse event summary metrics to complement the traditional maximum grade report. Onset time indicates the time period in which the maximum grade for a specific adverse event occurred and was defined as ""early"" (i.e. maximum grade happened for the first time before 6 weeks) or ""late"" (i.e. after the 6<sup>th</sup> week). Adverse event load indicates the overall severity of a specific adverse event over the entire treatment. Higher adverse event load indicates a worse overall experience. These metrics can be calculated for adverse events with different maximum grades, in treatments with planned changes (e.g. dosage changes), using data sets with different number of adverse event data points between treatments (e.g. treatments with longer cycle lengths may have less adverse event data points) and on data sets with different adverse event data availability (e.g. cycle basis and patient-outcome reports). We tested the utility of this method using individual patient data from two major backbone therapies (""Irinotecan"" and ""Oxaliplatin"") from the N9741 trial available in the Fondation ARCAD database (fondationarcad.org). We investigated profiles of diarrhea, neutropenia/leukopenia, and nausea/vomiting. Our method provided additional information compared to traditional adverse event reports. For example, for nausea/vomiting, while patients in Irinotecan had a higher risk of experiencing maximum grade 3-4 (15.6% vs 7.6%, respectively; p < 0.001), patients in both groups experienced similar severity over time (adverse effect load = 0.102 and 0.096, respectively; p = 0.26), suggesting that patients in Oxaliplatin experienced a lower-grade but more persistent nausea/vomiting. For neutropenia/leukopenia, more patients in Irinotecan experienced their maximum grade for the first time early in the treatment compared to patients in Oxaliplatin (67.9% vs 41.7%; p < 0.001), regardless of maximum grade. Longitudinal information can help compare treatments or guide clinicians on choosing appropriate interventions for low-grade but persistent adverse event or early adverse event onset. We developed an adverse event reporting method that provides clinically relevant information about treatment toxicity by incorporating two longitudinal adverse event metrics to the traditional maximum grade approach. Future research should establish clinical benchmarks for metrics included in this adverse event reporting method.",1,0,0,0,0
36055877,Serious adverse events of special interest following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in randomized trials in adults.,"In 2020, prior to COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the Brighton Collaboration created a priority list, endorsed by the World Health Organization, of potential adverse events relevant to COVID-19 vaccines. We adapted the Brighton Collaboration list to evaluate serious adverse events of special interest observed in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials. Secondary analysis of serious adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled, phase III randomized clinical trials of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in adults (NCT04368728 and NCT04470427), focusing analysis on Brighton Collaboration adverse events of special interest. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 10.1 and 15.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baselines of 17.6 and 42.2 (95 % CI -0.4 to 20.6 and -3.6 to 33.8), respectively. Combined, the mRNA vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 12.5 per 10,000 vaccinated (95 % CI 2.1 to 22.9); risk ratio 1.43 (95 % CI 1.07 to 1.92). The Pfizer trial exhibited a 36 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group; risk difference 18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated (95 % CI 1.2 to 34.9); risk ratio 1.36 (95 % CI 1.02 to 1.83). The Moderna trial exhibited a 6 % higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group: risk difference 7.1 per 10,000 (95 % CI -23.2 to 37.4); risk ratio 1.06 (95 % CI 0.84 to 1.33). Combined, there was a 16 % higher risk of serious adverse events in mRNA vaccine recipients: risk difference 13.2 (95 % CI -3.2 to 29.6); risk ratio 1.16 (95 % CI 0.97 to 1.39). The excess risk of serious adverse events found in our study points to the need for formal harm-benefit analyses, particularly those that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.

38536173,Patient-Reported Adverse Events and Early Treatment Discontinuation Among Patients With Multiple Myeloma.,"There is substantial interest in capturing cancer treatment tolerability from the patient's perspective using patient-reported outcomes (PROs). To examine whether a PRO question, item 5 from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General General Physical Wellbeing Scale (GP5), was associated with early treatment discontinuation (ETD) due to adverse events. This prospective survey study was conducted from February to April 2023. Among participants in the ECOG-ACRIN E1A11 trial (a phase 3, parallel design trial conducted between 2013 and 2019), patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were randomized to receive bortezomib (VRd) or carfilzomib (KRd) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone as induction therapy. The GP5 item was administered at baseline (pretreatment) and at 1 month, 2.8 months, and 5.5 months postbaseline. Eligible participants included patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated at community oncology practices or academic medical centers in the US. GP5 response options were ""very much,"" ""quite a bit,"" ""somewhat,"" ""a little bit,"" and ""not at all."" Responses at each assessment while undergoing treatment (1 month, 2.8 months, and 5.5 months) were categorized as high adverse event bother (ie, ""very much,"" and ""quite a bit"") and low adverse event bother (ie, ""somewhat,"" ""a little bit,"" or ""not at all""). In addition, change from baseline to each assessment while undergoing treatment was calculated and categorized as worsening by 1 response category and 2 or more response categories. ETD due to adverse events (yes vs no) was analyzed using logistic regression adjusting for treatment group, performance status, gender, race, and disease stage. Of the 1087 participants in the original trial, 1058 (mean [SD] age 64 [9] years; 531 receiving VrD [50.2%]; 527 receiving KRd [49.8%]) responded to item GP5 and were included in the secondary analysis. A small proportion (142 patients [13.4%]) discontinued treatment early due to AEs. For those with high adverse-effect bother, GP5 while undergoing treatment was associated with ETD at 1 month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.20; 95% CI, 1.25-3.89), 2.8 months (aOR, 3.41; 95% CI, 2.01-5.80), and 5.5 months (aOR, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.69-12.83). Worsening by 2 or more response categories on the GP5 was associated with ETD at 2.8 months (aOR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.64-5.54) and 5.5 months (aOR, 5.49; 95% CI, 1.45-20.76). In this survey study of the E1A11 trial, worse GP5 response was associated with ETD. These findings suggest that simple assessment of adverse-effect bother while receiving treatment is an efficient way to indicate treatment tolerability and ETD risk.",1,0,0,0,0

To examine the cumulative incidence and severity of ADRs and associated patient characteristics in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Prospective cohort study of older adults (aged ≥70 years, <i>N</i> = 592) recruited from 15 general practices in the Republic of Ireland. Manual review of the participant's general practice electronic medical record, linked to the national dispensed prescription medicine database, and a detailed, self-reported patient postal questionnaire. The primary outcomes were ADR occurrence and severity over a 6-year period (2010-2016). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models examined potential associations between patient characteristics and ADR occurrence. A total of 211 ADRs were recorded for 159 participants, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 26.9% over 6 years. The majority of ADRs detected were mild (89.1%), with the remainder classified as moderate (10.9%). Eight moderate ADRs, representing 34.8% of moderate ADRs and 3.8% of all ADRs, required an emergency hospital admission. ADRs were independently associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17 to 2.85; <i>P</i> = 0.008), polypharmacy (5-9 drug classes) (adjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.82; <i>P</i> = 0.008), and major polypharmacy (≥10 drug classes) (adjusted OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.62 to 6.85; <i>P</i> = 0.001). This prospective cohort study of ADRs in general practice shows that over one-quarter of older adults experienced an ADR over a 6-year period. Polypharmacy is independently associated with ADR risk in general practice and older adults on ≥10 drug classes should be prioritised for regular medication review.",1,0,1,0,0
30458579,On estimands and the analysis of adverse events in the presence of varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapies.,"The analysis of adverse events (AEs) is a key component in the assessment of a drug's safety profile. Inappropriate analysis methods may result in misleading conclusions about a therapy's safety and consequently its benefit-risk ratio. The statistical analysis of AEs is complicated by the fact that the follow-up times can vary between the patients included in a clinical trial. This paper takes as its focus the analysis of AE data in the presence of varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapeutic interventions. Instead of approaching this issue directly and solely from an analysis point of view, we first discuss what should be estimated in the context of safety data, leading to the concept of estimands. Although the current discussion on estimands is mainly related to efficacy evaluation, the concept is applicable to safety endpoints as well. Within the framework of estimands, we present statistical methods for analysing AEs with the focus being on the time to the occurrence of the first AE of a specific type. We give recommendations which estimators should be used for the estimands described. Furthermore, we state practical implications of the analysis of AEs in clinical trials and give an overview of examples across different indications. We also provide a review of current practices of health technology assessment (HTA) agencies with respect to the evaluation of safety data. Finally, we describe problems with meta-analyses of AE data and sketch possible solutions.",1,0,0,0,0
26140524,Psychiatric and behavioral adverse events in randomized clinical studies of the noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel.,"Perampanel, a selective, noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor antagonist, is indicated for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in patients ≥12 years based on three phase III clinical studies. The perampanel U.S. Prescribing Information includes a boxed warning for serious psychiatric and behavioral adverse reactions. To provide context for this warning, detail on psychiatric and behavioral safety data from perampanel clinical studies is presented. An analysis of pooled safety data from three phase III studies in patients with partial seizures is presented. Data from phase I and phase II studies in patients with and without epilepsy were also analyzed. Psychiatric and behavioral treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms, using ""narrow"" and ""narrow-and-broad"" standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) for TEAEs suggestive of hostility/aggression. From the three phase III partial-seizure studies, the overall rate of psychiatric TEAEs was higher in the 8 mg (17.2%) and 12 mg (22.4%) perampanel groups versus placebo (12.4%). In the ""narrow"" SMQ, hostility/aggression TEAEs were observed in 2.8% for 8 mg and 6.3% for 12 mg perampanel groups, versus 0.7% of placebo patients. ""Narrow-and-broad"" SMQs for hostility/aggression TEAE rates were 12.3% for 8 mg and 20.4% for 12 mg perampanel groups, versus 5.7% for placebo; rates for events resulting in discontinuation were perampanel = 1.6% versus placebo = 0.7%. For events reported as serious AEs (SAEs), rates were perampanel = 0.7% versus placebo = 0.2%. In nonepilepsy patients, psychiatric TEAEs were similar between patients receiving perampanel and placebo. In phase I subjects/volunteers, all psychiatric TEAEs were mild or moderate. These analyses suggest that psychiatric adverse effects are associated with use of perampanel. Patients and caregivers should be counseled regarding the potential risk of psychiatric and behavioral events with perampanel in patients with partial seizures; patients should be monitored for these events during treatment, especially during titration and at higher doses.",1,0,0,1,0
34391508,Treatment-related adverse events of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies in clinical trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Numerous ongoing trials are testing anti-PD-1-based or anti-PD-L1-based cancer treatment combinations. Understanding the toxicity profiles of treatment-related adverse events is essential. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the incidences and profiles of treatment-related adverse events across different combination therapies. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing different chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy combinations with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2000, and May 21, 2020, investigating globally approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies. Only prospective trials reporting overall incidence or tabulated data of treatment-related adverse events were included. Trials investigating sequential therapies, comprising three or more classes of therapies, and enrolling less than ten patients were excluded. The primary outcomes were overall incidences and profiles for all-grade and grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events by random-effect models. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with I<sup>2</sup> statistics. The summary measures for main outcomes are incidences (95% CI). The 95% CI were calculated together with the incidence through a random-effects model with a logit transformation. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020189617). We identified 2540 records, of which 161 studies (17 197 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events in the chemotherapy combination was 97·7% (95% CI 96·4-98·5; I<sup>2</sup>=75%) for all-grade adverse events and 68·3% (60·7-75·0; I<sup>2</sup>=93%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; in the targeted therapy combination was 94·5% (90·7-96·8; I<sup>2</sup>=86%) for all-grade adverse events and 47·3% (37·3-57·5; I<sup>2</sup>=93%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; in the immunotherapy combination was 86·8% (80·9-91·1; I<sup>2</sup>=94%) for all-grade adverse events and 35·9% (29·5-42·9; I<sup>2</sup>=92%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; and in the radiotherapy combination was 89·4% (69·0-96·9; I<sup>2</sup>=74%) for all-grade adverse events and 12·4% (4·4-30·6; I<sup>2</sup>=73%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events. For these four combination therapies, the most common all-grade adverse events were anaemia (45.4% [95% CI 32·4-59·1]), fatigue (34·3% [27·5-41·9]), fatigue (26·4% [19·2-35·2]), and dysphagia (30·0% [18·7-44·5]), respectively, and the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (19·6% [13·5-27·7]), hypertension (9·3% [5·7-14·9]), lipase increased (7·2% [5·2-9·9]), and lymphopenia (10·3% [4·5-21·8]). All included randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias. Our study provides comprehensive data on treatment-related adverse events of different PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies. Our results provide an essential reference of toxicity profiles of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies for clinicians in routine practice of cancer care.

28433211,Adverse Events During a Randomized Trial of Ketamine Versus Co-Administration of Ketamine and Propofol for Procedural Sedation in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,"The co-administration of ketamine and propofol (CoKP) is thought to maximize the beneficial profile of each medication, while minimizing the respective adverse effects of each medication. Our objective was to compare adverse events between ketamine monotherapy (KM) and CoKP for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in a pediatric emergency department (ED). This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial of KM vs. CoKP in patients between 3 and 21 years of age. The attending physician administered either ketamine 1 mg/kg i.v. or ketamine 0.5 mg/kg and propofol 0.5 mg/kg i.v. The physician could administer up to three additional doses of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg/dose) or ketamine/propofol (0.25 mg/kg/dose of each). Adverse events (e.g., respiratory events, cardiovascular events, unpleasant emergence reactions) were recorded. Secondary outcomes included efficacy, recovery time, and satisfaction scores. Ninety-six patients were randomized to KM and 87 patients were randomized to CoKP. There was no difference in adverse events or type of adverse event, except nausea was more common in the KM group. Efficacy of PSA was higher in the KM group (99%) compared to the CoKP group (90%). Median recovery time was the same. Satisfaction scores by providers, including nurses, were higher for KM, although parents were equally satisfied with both sedation regimens. We found no significant differences in adverse events between the KM and CoKP groups. While CoKP is a reasonable choice for pediatric PSA, our study did not demonstrate an advantage of this combination over KM.",1,0,0,0,0
37824028,Adverse Drug Reactions to Opioids: A Study in a National Pharmacovigilance Database.,"Opioids are commonly used as analgesics; however, like any medicine, they can produce adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including nausea, constipation, dependence, and respiratory depression, that result in harmful and fatal events. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the safety of these drugs in clinical practice. This study aimed to characterize the safety profile of opioids by conducting a descriptive study based on a spontaneous reporting system (SRS) for ADRs in The Netherlands, focusing on abuse, misuse, medication errors, and differences between sexes. Reports submitted to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb from January 2003 to December 2021 with an opioid drug as the suspected/interacting medicine were analyzed. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) for drug-ADR combinations were calculated, analyzed, and corrected for sex and drug utilization (expenditure) for the Dutch population. A total of 8769 reports were analyzed. Tramadol was the opioid with the most reports during the period (n = 2746), while oxycodone or tramadol had the highest number of reports per year in the study period. The most reported ADRs from opioid use were nausea, followed by dizziness and vomiting, independent of sex, and all of them were more often reported in women. Vomiting associated with tramadol (ROR females/males = 2.17) was significantly higher in women. Buprenorphine was responsible for most ADRs when corrected for expenditure, with high RORs observed with application site hypersensitivity, application site reaction, and application site rash. Fentanyl gave rise to most of the reports of ADRs concerning abuse, misuse, and medication errors. Patients treated with opioids experienced ADRs, primarily nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. For those groups of drugs, no significant differences were found between the sexes, except for the vomiting associated with tramadol. In general, ADRs related to opioids presented higher RORs when uncorrected and corrected for sexes and expenditure than other drugs. There was more disproportionate reporting for ADRs concerning abuse, misuse, and medication errors for opioids than other drugs in the Dutch SRS.",1,0,0,0,0
38854273,"Causality, Severity, Preventability and Predictability Assessments Scales for Adverse Drug Reactions: A Review.","The pharmacovigilance program of India (PvPI), after its inception, has been reliably acquiring force in bringing issues to light among the masses, healthcare professionals, the pharma industry, and clinical staff at hospitals. Adverse drug reactions are unintended events that occur after exposure to a drug, biological product, or medical device, and they may result in morbidity and mortality. It is critical to monitor the safety of drugs during the post-marketing phase to find long-term and rare ADRs, as well as ADRs in special populations and patients with co-morbidities that are not usually included during clinical trials. The definitive objective of pharmacovigilance is to collate data and analyze it. Assessing the causality between ADRs and drugs is necessary to decrease the occurrence of ADRs and to reduce the risk of drug-related ADRs. ADRs may lead to increased morbidity, increased hospital stays, and increased cost of treatment, resulting in compromised patient safety. Causality assessment is the evaluation of the likelihood that a particular treatment is the cause of an observed adverse event and establishing a causal association between a drug and a drug reaction is necessary to prevent further recurrences. Numerous methods available for establishing a causal association between the drug and adverse events have been broadly classified into clinical judgment or global introspection, algorithms, and probabilistic methods. These include the Swedish method, World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) scale, Naranjo's algorithm, Kramer algorithm, Jones algorithm, Karch algorithm, Bégaud algorithm, Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee guidelines, Bayesian Adverse Reaction Diagnostic Instrument, and so on. Despite various methods available, none of the causality assessment tools have been universally accepted as the gold standard. Naranjo's algorithm and WHO-UMC scales are, however, the most commonly used. Similarly, for preventability and severity assessment of ADRs, the Schumock and Thornton scale and Hartwig and Siegel's scale are most commonly used. Hence, we reviewed different tools and methods available to assess the causality, preventability, and severity of ADRs.",1,0,0,0,0
37948080,Adverse Event Reporting in Randomized Clinical Trials for Multiple Myeloma.,"Cancer treatment can result in burdensome toxic effects that profoundly affect patient quality of life. In seeking to emphasize the efficacy of tested treatments, clinical trial reports may use subjective or minimizing terms to describe adverse events (AEs). To evaluate patterns of AE reporting in multiple myeloma (MM) randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published between 2015 and early 2023. For this cohort study, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to assess the prevalence of minimizing terms in MM RCTs published between January 1, 2015, and March 1, 2023. Minimizing terms were defined as subjective terms used to favorably describe the safety profile of the intervention. The terms searched included convenient, manageable, acceptable, expected, well-tolerated, tolerable, favorable, and safe. Final data analysis was performed on July 21, 2023. The primary outcome was the occurrence of at least 1 minimizing term in an article. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the presence of at least 1 minimizing term and the actual incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs, serious AEs, or grade 5 AEs. Of the 65 RCTs included, 56 (86%) used minimizing terms when describing treatment-emergent AEs. The most frequently used minimizing terms were well-tolerated or tolerable in 29 trials (45%), manageable in 18 (28%), and acceptable in 16 (25%). Grade 3 or 4 AE rate in the examined RCTs ranged from 23% to 94%, with a median of 75% (IQR, 59%-82%). A univariate regression analysis demonstrated no association between the use of minimizing terms and grade 3 or 4 AE rates (odds ratio [OR], 1.35 [95% CI, 0.88-2.10] per 10% AE rate increase; P = .17) or grade 5 AE rates (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 0.27-12.7] per 10% AE rate increase; P = .45). These findings suggest that trial investigators and sponsors regularly use minimizing terms to describe toxic effects in MM trials, and use of this terminology may not reflect actual AE rates in these studies. Instead of using these terms, trial investigators should highlight event rates and patient-reported outcomes, to allow clinicians and patients to better evaluate the true tolerability of AEs.",1,0,0,0,0
35788071,"Adverse drug reactions, multimorbidity and polypharmacy: a prospective analysis of 1 month of medical admissions.","To ascertain the burden and associated cost of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), polypharmacy and multimorbidity through a prospective analysis of all medical admissions to a large university teaching hospital over a 1-month period. Prospective observational study. Liverpool University Hospital Foundation National Health Service (NHS) Trust, England. All medical admissions with greater than 24-hour stay over a 1-month period. Prevalence of admissions due to an ADR and associated mortality, prevalence and association of multimorbidity and polypharmacy with ADRs, and estimated local financial cost of admissions where an ADR was a contributing or main reason for admission with projected costs for NHS in England. There were 218 identified patient admissions with an ADR giving a prevalence of 18.4%. The majority of these (90.4%) were ADRs that directly resulted in or contributed to admission. ADRs thus accounted for 16.5% of total admissions. Those with an ADR were on average taking more medicines (10.5 vs 7.8, p<0.01) and had more comorbidities than those without an ADR (6.1 vs 5.2, p<0.01). Drugs most commonly implicated were diuretics, steroid inhalers, anticoagulants and antiplatelets, proton pump inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents and antihypertensives. 40.4% of ADRs were classified avoidable or possibly avoidable. The mortality rate due to an ADR was 0.34%. The average length of stay for those with an ADR was 6 days. Direct 1-month cost to the Trust from ADR admissions was £490 716. Extrapolated nationally, the projected annual cost to the NHS in England is 2.21 billion. The local prevalence of admission and mortality from ADRs is higher than previously reported. Important factors that could be contributing to this include polypharmacy and multimorbidity. ADRs place a significant burden on patients and healthcare services with associated financial implications. Reducing inappropriate polypharmacy should be a major aim for preventing ADRs.",1,0,0,0,0
27016266,Adverse drug event reporting systems: a systematic review.,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) are harmful and unintended consequences of medications. Their reporting is essential for drug safety monitoring and research, but it has not been standardized internationally. Our aim was to synthesize information about the type and variety of data collected within ADE reporting systems. We developed a systematic search strategy, applied it to four electronic databases, and completed an electronic grey literature search. Two authors reviewed titles and abstracts, and all eligible full-texts. We extracted data using a standardized form, and discussed disagreements until reaching consensus. We synthesized data by collapsing data elements, eliminating duplicate fields and identifying relationships between reporting concepts and data fields using visual analysis software. We identified 108 ADE reporting systems containing 1782 unique data fields. We mapped them to 33 reporting concepts describing patient information, the ADE, concomitant and suspect drugs, and the reporter. While reporting concepts were fairly consistent, we found variability in data fields and corresponding response options. Few systems clarified the terminology used, and many used multiple drug and disease dictionaries such as the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). We found substantial variability in the data fields used to report ADEs, limiting the comparability of ADE data collected using different reporting systems, and undermining efforts to aggregate data across cohorts. The development of a common standardized data set that can be evaluated with regard to data quality, comparability and reporting rates is likely to optimize ADE data and drug safety surveillance.",1,0,0,0,0
34222847,Nitazoxanide superiority to placebo to treat moderate COVID-19 - A Pilot prove of concept randomized double-blind clinical trial.,"The absence of specific antivirals to treat COVID-19 leads to the repositioning of candidates' drugs. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has a broad antiviral effect. This was a randomized, double-blind pilot clinical trial comparing NTZ 600 mg BID versus Placebo for seven days among 50 individuals (25 each arm) with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR+ (PCR) that were hospitalized with mild respiratory insufficiency from May 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020, to September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04348409). Clinical and virologic endpoints and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. A five-point scale for disease severity (SSD) was used. Two patients died in the NTZ arm compared to 6 in the placebo arm (<i>p</i> = 0.564). NTZ was superior to placebo when considering SSD (<i>p</i> < 0001), the mean time for hospital discharge (6.6 vs. 14 days, <i>p</i> = 0.021), and negative PCR at day 21 (<i>p</i> = 0.035), whereas the placebo group presented more adverse events (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Among adverse events likely related to the study drug, 14 were detected in the NTZ group and 22 in placebo (<i>p</i> = 0.24). Among the 30 adverse events unlikely related, 21 occurred in the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.04). A decrease from baseline was higher in the NTZ group for d-Dimer (<i>p</i> = 0.001), US-RCP (<i>p</i> < 0.002), TNF (<i>p</i> < 0.038), IL-6 (<i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-8 (<i>p</i> = 0.014), HLA DR. on CD4<sup>+</sup> <i>T</i> lymphocytes (<i>p</i> < 0.05), CD38 in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> <i>T</i> (both <i>p</i> < 0.05), and CD38 and HLA-DR. on CD4+ (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Compared to placebo in clinical and virologic outcomes and improvement of inflammatory outcomes, the superiority of NTZ warrants further investigation of this drug for moderate COVID-19 in larger clinical trials. A higher incidence of adverse events in the placebo arm might be attributed to COVID-19 related symptoms.",1,0,0,0,0
23602344,"Adverse event assessment, analysis, and reporting in recent published analgesic clinical trials: ACTTION systematic review and recommendations.","The development of valid and informative treatment risk-benefit profiles requires consistent and thorough information about adverse event (AE) assessment and participants' AEs during randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Despite a 2004 extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement recommending the specific AE information that investigators should report, there is little evidence that analgesic RCTs adequately adhere to these recommendations. This systematic review builds on prior recommendations by describing a comprehensive checklist for AE reporting developed to capture clinically important AE information. Using this checklist, we coded AE assessment methods and reporting in all 80 double-blind RCTs of noninvasive pharmacologic treatments published in the European Journal of Pain, Journal of Pain, and PAIN® from 2006 to 2011. Across all trials, reports of AEs were frequently incomplete, inconsistent across trials, and, in some cases, missing. For example, >40% of trials failed to report any information on serious adverse events. Trials of participants with acute or chronic pain conditions and industry-sponsored trials typically provided more and better-quality AE data than trials involving pain-free volunteers or trials that were not industry sponsored. The results of this review suggest that improved AE reporting is needed in analgesic RCTs. We developed an ACTTION (Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks) AE reporting checklist that is intended to assist investigators in thoroughly and consistently capturing and reporting these critically important data in publications.",1,0,0,0,0
32998522,"Adverse event load, onset, and maximum grade: A novel method of reporting adverse events in cancer clinical trials.","Current adverse event reporting practices do not document longitudinal characteristics of adverse effects, and alternative methods are not easily interpretable and have not been employed by clinical trials. Introducing time parameters in the evaluation of safety that are comprehensive yet easily interpretable could allow for a better understanding of treatment quality. In this study, we developed and applied a novel adverse event reporting method based on longitudinal adverse event changes to aid describing, summarizing, and presenting adverse event profile. We termed it the ""Adverse Event Load, Onset, and Maximum Grade"" method. We developed two adverse event summary metrics to complement the traditional maximum grade report. Onset time indicates the time period in which the maximum grade for a specific adverse event occurred and was defined as ""early"" (i.e. maximum grade happened for the first time before 6 weeks) or ""late"" (i.e. after the 6<sup>th</sup> week). Adverse event load indicates the overall severity of a specific adverse event over the entire treatment. Higher adverse event load indicates a worse overall experience. These metrics can be calculated for adverse events with different maximum grades, in treatments with planned changes (e.g. dosage changes), using data sets with different number of adverse event data points between treatments (e.g. treatments with longer cycle lengths may have less adverse event data points) and on data sets with different adverse event data availability (e.g. cycle basis and patient-outcome reports). We tested the utility of this method using individual patient data from two major backbone therapies (""Irinotecan"" and ""Oxaliplatin"") from the N9741 trial available in the Fondation ARCAD database (fondationarcad.org). We investigated profiles of diarrhea, neutropenia/leukopenia, and nausea/vomiting. Our method provided additional information compared to traditional adverse event reports. For example, for nausea/vomiting, while patients in Irinotecan had a higher risk of experiencing maximum grade 3-4 (15.6% vs 7.6%, respectively; p < 0.001), patients in both groups experienced similar severity over time (adverse effect load = 0.102 and 0.096, respectively; p = 0.26), suggesting that patients in Oxaliplatin experienced a lower-grade but more persistent nausea/vomiting. For neutropenia/leukopenia, more patients in Irinotecan experienced their maximum grade for the first time early in the treatment compared to patients in Oxaliplatin (67.9% vs 41.7%; p < 0.001), regardless of maximum grade. Longitudinal information can help compare treatments or guide clinicians on choosing appropriate interventions for low-grade but persistent adverse event or early adverse event onset. We developed an adverse event reporting method that provides clinically relevant information about treatment toxicity by incorporating two longitudinal adverse event metrics to the traditional maximum grade approach. Future research should establish clinical benchmarks for metrics included in this adverse event reporting method.",1,0,0,0,0
39230883,Adverse Events in Studies of Classic Psychedelics: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"A clear and comprehensive understanding of risks associated with psychedelic-assisted therapy is necessary as investigators extend its application to new populations and indications. To assess adverse events (AEs) associated with classic psychedelics, particularly serious AEs (SAEs) and nonserious AEs (NSAEs) requiring medical or psychiatric evaluation. The search for potentially eligible studies was conducted in the Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases from inception through February 8, 2024. Two independent reviewers screened articles of classic psychedelics (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine [DMT], and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine [5-MeO-DMT]) involving administration in clinical or research contexts. AE data were extracted and synthesized by 2 reviewers and were used for random-effects meta-analysis of AE frequency and heterogeneity. Risk of bias assessment focused on AE ascertainment (eg, systematic assessment and quality of follow-up). A hybrid approach was used for capture of all reported AEs following high-dose classic psychedelic exposure and confirmatory capture of AEs of special interest, including suicidality, psychotic disorder, manic symptoms, cardiovascular events, and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. AEs were stratified by timescale and study population type. Forest plots of common AEs were generated, and the proportions of participants affected by SAEs or NSAEs requiring medical intervention were summarized descriptively. A total of 214 unique studies were included, of which 114 (53.3%) reported analyzable AE data for 3504 total participants. SAEs were reported for no healthy participants and for approximately 4% of participants with preexisting neuropsychiatric disorders; among these SAEs were worsening depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, and convulsive episodes. NSAEs requiring medical intervention (eg, paranoia, headache) were similarly rare. In contemporary research settings, there were no reports of deaths by suicide, persistent psychotic disorders, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorders following administration of high-dose classic psychedelics. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the quality of AE monitoring and reporting. Of 68 analyzed studies published since 2005, only 16 (23.5%) described systematic approaches to AE assessment, and 20 studies (29.4%) reported all AEs, as opposed to only adverse drug reactions. Meta-analyses of prevalence for common AEs (eg, headache, anxiety, nausea, fatigue, and dizziness) yielded comparable results for psilocybin and LSD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, classic psychedelics were generally well tolerated in clinical or research settings according to the existing literature, although SAEs did occur. These results provide estimates of common AE frequencies and indicate that certain catastrophic events reported in recreational or nonclinical contexts have yet to be reported in contemporary trial participants. Careful, ongoing, and improved pharmacovigilance is required to understand the risk and benefit profiles of these substances and to communicate such risks to prospective study participants and the public.",1,0,0,0,0

To determine the change in the rate of adverse events in hospitalized patients. This serial cross-sectional study used data from the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System from 2010 to 2019 to assess in-hospital adverse events in patients. The study included 244 542 adult patients hospitalized in 3156 US acute care hospitals across 4 condition groups from 2010 through 2019: acute myocardial infarction (17%), heart failure (17%), pneumonia (21%), and major surgical procedures (22%); and patients hospitalized from 2012 through 2019 for all other conditions (22%). Adults aged 18 years or older hospitalized during each included calendar year. Information on adverse events (abstracted from medical records) included 21 measures across 4 adverse event domains: adverse drug events, hospital-acquired infections, adverse events after a procedure, and general adverse events (hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and falls). The outcomes were the total change over time for the observed and risk-adjusted adverse event rates in the subpopulations. The study sample included 190 286 hospital discharges combined in the 4 condition-based groups of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, and major surgical procedures (mean age, 68.0 [SD, 15.9] years; 52.6% were female) and 54 256 hospital discharges for the group including all other conditions (mean age, 57.7 [SD, 20.7] years; 59.8% were female) from 3156 acute care hospitals across the US. From 2010 to 2019, the total change was from 218 to 139 adverse events per 1000 discharges for acute myocardial infarction, from 168 to 116 adverse events per 1000 discharges for heart failure, from 195 to 119 adverse events per 1000 discharges for pneumonia, and from 204 to 130 adverse events per 1000 discharges for major surgical procedures. From 2012 to 2019, the rate of adverse events for all other conditions remained unchanged at 70 adverse events per 1000 discharges. After adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the annual change represented by relative risk in all adverse events per 1000 discharges was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.94) for acute myocardial infarction, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.96) for heart failure, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.95) for pneumonia, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.94) for major surgical procedures, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99) for all other conditions. The risk-adjusted adverse event rates declined significantly in all patient groups for adverse drug events, hospital-acquired infections, and general adverse events. For patients in the major surgical procedures group, the risk-adjusted rates of events after a procedure declined significantly. In the US between 2010 and 2019, there was a significant decrease in the rates of adverse events abstracted from medical records for patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, and major surgical procedures and there was a significant decrease in the adjusted rates of adverse events between 2012 and 2019 for all other conditions. Further research is needed to understand the extent to which these trends represent a change in patient safety.",1,0,0,0,0

27649528,Reporting of Adverse Events in Published and Unpublished Studies of Health Care Interventions: A Systematic Review.,"We performed a systematic review to assess whether we can quantify the underreporting of adverse events (AEs) in the published medical literature documenting the results of clinical trials as compared with other nonpublished sources, and whether we can measure the impact this underreporting has on systematic reviews of adverse events. Studies were identified from 15 databases (including MEDLINE and Embase) and by handsearching, reference checking, internet searches, and contacting experts. The last database searches were conducted in July 2016. There were 28 methodological evaluations that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 9 studies compared the proportion of trials reporting adverse events by publication status. The median percentage of published documents with adverse events information was 46% compared to 95% in the corresponding unpublished documents. There was a similar pattern with unmatched studies, for which 43% of published studies contained adverse events information compared to 83% of unpublished studies. A total of 11 studies compared the numbers of adverse events in matched published and unpublished documents. The percentage of adverse events that would have been missed had each analysis relied only on the published versions varied between 43% and 100%, with a median of 64%. Within these 11 studies, 24 comparisons of named adverse events such as death, suicide, or respiratory adverse events were undertaken. In 18 of the 24 comparisons, the number of named adverse events was higher in unpublished than published documents. Additionally, 2 other studies demonstrated that there are substantially more types of adverse events reported in matched unpublished than published documents. There were 20 meta-analyses that reported the odds ratios (ORs) and/or risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events with and without unpublished data. Inclusion of unpublished data increased the precision of the pooled estimates (narrower 95% confidence intervals) in 15 of the 20 pooled analyses, but did not markedly change the direction or statistical significance of the risk in most cases. The main limitations of this review are that the included case examples represent only a small number amongst thousands of meta-analyses of harms and that the included studies may suffer from publication bias, whereby substantial differences between published and unpublished data are more likely to be published. There is strong evidence that much of the information on adverse events remains unpublished and that the number and range of adverse events is higher in unpublished than in published versions of the same study. The inclusion of unpublished data can also reduce the imprecision of pooled effect estimates during meta-analysis of adverse events.",1,0,0,0,0
29685700,Randomized clinical trials and observational studies in the assessment of drug safety.,"Randomized clinical trials are considered as the preferred design to assess the potential causal relationships between drugs or other medical interventions and intended effects. For this reason, randomized clinical trials are generally the basis of development programs in the life cycle of drugs and the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. Instead, randomized clinical trials are not the design of choice for the detection and assessment of rare, delayed and/or unexpected effects related to drug safety. Moreover, the highly homogeneous populations resulting from restrictive eligibility criteria make randomized clinical trials inappropriate to describe comprehensively the safety profile of drugs. In that context, observational studies have a key added value when evaluating the benefit-risk balance of the drugs. However, observational studies are more prone to bias than randomized clinical trials and they have to be designed, conducted and reported judiciously. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of randomized clinical trials and of observational studies, more particularly regarding their contribution to the knowledge of medicines' safety profile. In addition, we present general recommendations for the sensible use of observational data.",1,0,0,0,0
37909676,Efficacy and Safety of Rimegepant for Migraine Patients: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Studies.,"Rimegepant may have some potential in treating migraine, and this meta-analysis aims to study the efficacy and safety of rimegepant for migraine patients. We have searched several databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library databases and selected the randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of rimegepant versus placebo for migraine patients. This meta-analysis was conducted using the random- or fixed-effect model based on the heterogeneity. Three randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo in migraine patients, rimegepant treatment was associated with substantially improved freedom from pain at 2 hours (odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-2.59; P < 0.00001), pain relief at 2 hours (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.65 to 2.25; P < 0.00001), freedom from the most bothersome symptom at 2 hours (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35-1.91; P < 0.00001), ability to function normally at 2 hours (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.42-2.01; P < 0.00001), sustained freedom from pain at 24 hours (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.74-4.78; P < 0.0001), sustained pain relief at 24 hours (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.96-2.72; P < 0.00001), and no rescue medication (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.02-2.90; P < 0.00001) but showed no obvious impact on adverse events (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60; P = 0.04).

38476099,"Pharmacokinetics and safety of erenumab in pediatric patients with migraine: A phase I, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose study.","Erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is efficacious and safe for prevention of attacks of migraine in adults. This phase I, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of erenumab in children and adolescents with migraine. The initial treatment phase lasted 12 weeks, followed by an optional 40-week extension phase for adolescents. Primary end points were PK of erenumab, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and changes in clinical and laboratory assessments. Participants received erenumab 35 mg (n = 4), 70 mg (n = 17), or 140 mg (n = 32) q4w. The mean age was 14.1 years. Of the 53 participants, 48 (90.6%) completed the initial treatment phase and 36 (67.9%) received erenumab during the extension phase. Mean exposures to erenumab based on the maximum observed concentration and the area under the drug concentration-time curve during the dosing interval increased approximately dose-proportionally. A total of 42 participants (79.2%) reported TEAEs (307.2 per 100 participant-years); and four (7.5%) reported serious TEAEs not considered treatment-related. The most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and vomiting. No clinically significant changes were reported in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory and neurological assessments. Overall, the observed PK profile of erenumab in children and adolescents with migraine is consistent with that in adults when body weight differences are taken into consideration. The safety profile of erenumab in children and adolescents is consistent with that in adults.",1,1,0,0,0
40388178,Efficacy and Safety of Eptinezumab in Episodic Cluster Headache: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Cluster headache, characterized by bouts of excruciating pain attacks, detrimentally affects health and quality of life. Eptinezumab is an anticalcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody approved for migraine prevention. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in the preventive treatment of episodic cluster headache. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) clinical trial (Eptinezumab in Participants With Episodic Cluster Headache [ALLEVIATE]) was conducted between December 2020 and October 2023. Results are from the initial 4-week randomized phase. The study took place at 64 sites across Europe, the US, and Japan. Included were adults (aged 18-75 years) with a history of episodic cluster headache for 1 or more years (with bouts lasting ≥6 weeks when untreated) and previous acute and preventive medication use. Eptinezumab, 400 mg, or placebo (intravenous infusion). The primary end point was the change from baseline in the number of weekly attacks in weeks 1 to 2. Safety was assessed using treatment-emergent adverse events. Of 628 total participants screened, 320 entered the second screening period, and 231 met eligibility criteria. Of the 231 participants randomized (eptinezumab, n = 118; placebo, n = 113), 215 (93%) completed the placebo-controlled period. The participant mean (SD) age was 44 (11) years, and 178 of 229 were male (78%). At baseline, the mean (SD) weekly attacks were 15.2 (8.1) in the eptinezumab group and 15.7 (8.3) in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference between eptinezumab and placebo in the change from baseline in the number of weekly attacks over weeks 1 to 2 (least-squares mean [SE], -4.0 [0.93] vs -4.6 [0.89]; between-group difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -1.3 to 2.6; P = .50). More eptinezumab-treated participants achieved 50% or greater response vs placebo over week 2 (50.9% [54 of 106] vs 37.3% [41 of 110]; odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.07; P =.04), week 3 (62.5% [65 of 104] vs 43.8% [49 of 112]; OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.30-3.97; P =.004), and week 4 (66.7% [68 of 102] vs 50.5% [54 of 107]; OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.21-3.83; P =.009). Eptinezumab showed numerically larger improvements than placebo for 75% or greater response, average daily pain scores, and across other patient-reported outcomes. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 25.0% of patients (28 of 112) receiving eptinezumab and 26.5% of patients (31 of 117) receiving placebo. Among adults with episodic cluster headache, eptinezumab did not significantly reduce the number of attacks vs placebo, although it was associated with numerically higher responder rates and improvements in average daily pain and patient-reported outcomes. Eptinezumab was generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04688775.",1,1,0,1,0
36630140,Efficacy and Safety of Lebrikizumab in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids in Adolescents and Adults With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial (ADhere).,"Lebrikizumab (LEB), a high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-13, demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) during 16 weeks of monotherapy in a phase 2b trial, and two 52-week phase 3 trials. To evaluate efficacy and safety of LEB combined with low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The ADhere trial was a 16-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo (PBO)-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial conducted from February 3, 2020, to September 16, 2021. The study was conducted at 54 outpatient sites across Germany, Poland, Canada, and the US and included adolescent (aged ≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) and adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The treatment allocation ratio was 2:1 (LEB:PBO). Overall, 211 patients were randomized to subcutaneous LEB (loading dose of 500 mg at baseline and week 2, followed by 250 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W] thereafter) or PBO Q2W in combination with TCS for 16 weeks. Efficacy analyses at week 16 included proportions of patients achieving Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (IGA [0,1]) with 2 or more points improvement from baseline, and 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75). Key secondary end points included evaluation of itch, itch interference on sleep, and quality of life. Safety assessments included monitoring adverse events (AEs). The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.2 (19.3) years, 103 (48.8%) patients were women, 31 (14.7%) patients were Asian, and 28 (13.3%) patients were Black/African American. At week 16, IGA (0,1) was achieved by 145 (41.2%) patients in the LEB+TCS group vs 66 (22.1%) receiving PBO+TCS (P = .01); corresponding proportions of patients achieving EASI-75 were 69.5% vs 42.2% (P < .001). The LEB+TCS group showed statistically significant improvements in all key secondary end points. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nonserious, mild or moderate in severity, and did not lead to study discontinuation. The TEAEs frequently reported in the LEB+TCS group included conjunctivitis (7 [4.8%]), headache (7 [4.8%]), hypertension (4 [2.8%]), injection site reactions (4 [2.8%]), and herpes infection (5 [3.4%]) vs 1.5% or less patient-reported frequencies in the PBO+TCS group. Similar frequencies of patient-reported serious AEs following LEB+TCS (n = 2, 1.4%) and PBO+TCS (n = 1, 1.5%). In this randomized phase 3 clinical trial, LEB+TCS was associated with improved outcomes in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe AD compared with TCS alone, and safety was consistent with previously reported AD trials.

39470185,Improving adverse drug event reporting by healthcare professionals.,"Adverse drug events, encompassing both adverse drug reactions and medication errors, pose a significant threat to health, leading to illness and, in severe cases, death. Timely and voluntary reporting of adverse drug events by healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in mitigating the morbidity and mortality linked to unexpected reactions and improper medication usage. To assess the effectiveness of different interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to improve the reporting of adverse drug events. We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE and several other electronic databases and trials registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, from inception until 14 October 2022. We also screened reference lists in the included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised trials, non-randomised controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (ITS) and repeated measures studies, assessing the effect of any intervention aimed at healthcare professionals and designed to increase adverse drug event reporting. Eligible comparators were healthcare professionals' usual reporting practice or a different intervention or interventions designed to improve adverse drug event reporting rate. We excluded studies of interventions targeted at adverse event reporting following immunisation. Our primary outcome measures were the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) and the number of false adverse drug event reports (encompassing both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) submitted by healthcare professionals. Secondary outcomes were the number of serious, high-causality, unexpected or previously unknown, and new drug-related adverse drug event reports submitted by healthcare professionals. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We extracted and reanalysed ITS study data and imputed treatment effect estimates (including standard errors or confidence intervals) for the randomised studies. We included 15 studies (eight RCTs, six ITS, and one non-randomised cross-over study) with approximately 62,389 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries in large tertiary care hospitals. There was a high risk of performance bias in the controlled studies due to the nature of the interventions. None of the ITS studies had a control arm, so we could not be sure of the detected effects being independent of other changes. None of the studies reported on the number of false adverse drug event reports submitted. There is low-certainty evidence suggesting that an education session, together with reminder card and adverse drug reaction (ADR) report form, may substantially improve the rate of ADR reporting by healthcare professionals when compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting with or without some training provided by regional pharmacosurveillance units). These educational interventions increased the number of ADR reports in total (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.90; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), serious ADR reports (RR 3.30, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.21; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), high-causality ADR reports (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.57; 5 studies, 21,655 participants), unexpected ADR reports (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.75 to 12.76; 4 studies, 15,085 participants) and new drug-related ADR reports (RR 8.68, 95% CI 3.40 to 22.13; 2 studies, 7884 participants). Additionally, low-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting), making it easier to report ADRs by using a standardised discharge form with added ADR items may slightly improve the total number of ADR reports submitted (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.83; 1 study, 5967 participants). The discharge form tested was based on the 'Diagnosis Related Groups' (DRG) system for recording patient diagnoses, and the medical and surgical procedures received during their hospital stay. Due to very low-certainty evidence, we do not know if the following interventions have any effect on the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both ADR and ME reports) submitted by healthcare professionals: - sending informational letters or emails to GPs and nurses; - multifaceted interventions, including financial and non-financial incentives, fines, education and reminder cards; - implementing government regulations together with financial incentives; - including ADR report forms in quarterly bulletins and prescription pads; - providing a hyperlink to the reporting form in hospitals' electronic patient records; - improving the reporting method by re-engineering a web-based electronic error reporting system; - the presence of a clinical pharmacist in a hospital setting actively identifying adverse drug events and advocating for the identification and reporting of adverse drug events. Compared to usual practice (i.e. spontaneous reporting with or without some training from regional pharmacosurveillance units), low-certainty evidence suggests that the number of ADR reports submitted may substantially increase following an education session, paired with reminder card and ADR report form, and may slightly increase with the use of a standardised discharge form method that makes it easier for healthcare professionals to report ADRs. The evidence for other interventions identified in this review, such as informational letters or emails and financial incentives, is uncertain. Future studies need to assess the benefits (increase in the number of adverse drug event reports) and harms (increase in the number of false adverse drug event reports) of any intervention designed to improve healthcare professionals' reporting of adverse drug events. Interventions to increase the number of submitted adverse drug event reports that are suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries should be developed and rigorously evaluated.",1,0,0,0,0
